title: Implement `rmplan workspace add` Command and Plan Association
goal: To deliver a fully functional `rmplan workspace add` command that allows
  manual creation of workspaces, with optional linking to a plan file and
  appropriate status updates for that plan.

  title: Add `rmplan workspace add` Command
  goal: The project aims to introduce a new CLI command, `rmplan workspace add`,
    enabling users to manually create and initialize a new workspace. This
    command will optionally allow associating the new workspace with a specific
    plan, updating the plan's status to `in_progress` in both the current
    context and the newly created workspace.
  details: >
    Currently, workspaces are primarily created implicitly as part of the
    `rmplan run` (or `agent`) command. This feature will provide an explicit
    mechanism for workspace creation, offering more granular control.


    The command will:

    1.  Accept an optional plan identifier (ID or file path).

    2.  Accept an optional workspace ID. If not provided, one will be generated.

    3.  Utilize the existing `createWorkspace` function from
    `src/rmplan/workspace/workspace_manager.ts`.

    4.  If a plan is specified:
        *   The plan file will be resolved.
        *   Its status will be set to `in_progress` in the current context (e.g., the source repository).
        *   The plan file will be copied to the new workspace during its creation.
        *   The status of the plan file within the new workspace will also be `in_progress`.
    5.  If no plan is specified, a new workspace will be created without an
    associated plan.

    6.  Relevant types like `WorkspaceInfo` will be updated to reflect that a
    plan association is optional.


    This feature will enhance flexibility in managing workspaces, particularly
    for scenarios where a user wants to set up a workspace environment before
    running an agent or for a task not yet defined by a formal plan file.
tasks:
  - title: Define `workspace add` CLI command structure
    done: true
    description: This task involves adding the `workspace add` subcommand to the
      main `rmplan` CLI program defined in `src/rmplan/rmplan.ts`. The command
      should accept an optional positional argument for the plan identifier
      (which can be a plan ID or a file path) and an optional `--id
      <workspaceId>` option for specifying a custom workspace ID.
  - title: Implement helper function to update plan status
    done: true
    description: Create a new utility function, tentatively named `setPlanStatus`,
      likely within `src/rmplan/plans.ts`. This function will take a plan file
      path and a new status (e.g., 'pending', 'in_progress', 'done') as input.
      It will be responsible for reading the specified YAML plan file, updating
      its `status` and `updatedAt` fields, and then writing the modified plan
      back to the file system. This function will not handle git commits itself.
  - title: Adapt `WorkspaceInfo` and related types for optional plan
    done: true
    description: Modify the `WorkspaceInfo` interface in
      `src/rmplan/workspace/workspace_tracker.ts` and the `Workspace` interface
      in `src/rmplan/workspace/workspace_manager.ts`. The `originalPlanFilePath`
      field in these interfaces should be made optional to reflect that a
      workspace might be created without an associated plan. The `taskId` field
      in these types will represent the workspace ID.
  - title: Enhance `createWorkspace` for optional plan file
    done: true
    description: >
      Update the `createWorkspace` function in
      `src/rmplan/workspace/workspace_manager.ts`.

      The `originalPlanFilePath` argument will now be `string | undefined`.

      The function will:

      - If a plan is provided, copy it into the new workspace.

      - Use the `taskId` (which is the workspace ID) for branch naming with the
      prefix `llmutils-ws/`.

      - Handle environment variables for post-clone commands gracefully if no
      plan is specified.

      - Adjust the call to `recordWorkspace` for an optional
      `originalPlanFilePath`.
  - title: Implement core logic for `workspace add` command handler
    done: true
    description: Develop the action handler for the `rmplan rmplan workspace add`
      command. This logic will integrate previous tasks to create workspaces,
      optionally link plans, and update plan statuses.
  - title: Add comprehensive tests
    done: true
    description: Write unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability of the
      new functionality. Test cases should cover various scenarios including
      plan-less and plan-associated workspace creation, status updates, and ID
      handling.
  - title: Update documentation
    done: true
    description: Update the project's `README.md` file and any other relevant
      documentation to include details about the new `rmplan workspace add`
      command. This should cover its purpose, syntax, options, and examples of
      usage.

This phase focuses on adding the new command to the CLI, implementing the core logic for workspace creation, and handling the optional association with a plan. This includes updating the plan's status in both the source location and the new workspace. Existing workspace management and plan utilities will be leveraged and extended.
