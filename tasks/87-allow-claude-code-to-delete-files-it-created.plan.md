title: Allow Claude Code to delete files it created
goal: The project aims to add a configuration option to the Claude code executor
  that, when enabled, permits it to automatically approve any `rm` or `rm -f`
  command that targets a file previously created or modified by the agent within
  the same session.

# Original Plan Details

Claude code often creates files to run for tests and then later deletes them. We should add a configuration option to the Claude code executor that permits it to auto-approve any command running bash tool that removes a file it created.

For this, we will need to track uses of the write, edit, and multi-edit tools and keep a Set of all the paths that have been written. Then, when we see a Bash command in the permissions MCP that wants to run `rm <path>` or `rm-f <path>`, we can check if the file is in the set of files written and automatically return an "Allow" if it is. 

When this happens, we should print a log message that we are auto-approving the rm command.

# Processed Plan Details

## Allow Claude Code to automatically delete files it created

This feature will improve the user experience by reducing the number of manual approvals required for routine cleanup tasks performed by the agent. To achieve this, we will track all file paths modified by the `write`, `edit`, and `multi-edit` tools in a session-specific set. When the `bash` tool is invoked with a file deletion command, the system will check if the target file is in this set. If it is, and the feature is enabled, the command will be automatically approved.

### Acceptance Criteria
- A new configuration option, `autoApproveFileDeletion`, is available for the code executor and defaults to `false`.
- When `autoApproveFileDeletion` is `true`, any `bash` command executing `rm <path>` or `rm -f <path>` is automatically approved if `<path>` refers to a file previously created or modified by the `write`, `edit`, or `multi-edit` tools in the current session.
- When a deletion is auto-approved, a log message is printed indicating the action and the file path.
- If `autoApproveFileDeletion` is `false`, all `rm` commands continue to require manual user approval.
- Deletion commands for files not created or modified by the agent in the current session will always require manual approval, regardless of the configuration setting.
- The feature is covered by comprehensive integration tests.
- Project documentation is updated to reflect the new configuration option.
