This project is designed to implement the feature: Simpler plan IDs

- Change from the autogenerated alphanumeric ID to numeric IDs which are easier to deal with. Each new ID is just 1 more than the maximum ID.
- Autoresolve conflicting IDs (say, after merging two git branches together), by just reassigning the later ones to new IDs.
- When saving multiphase plans, just assign each task generated to be a separate task in the system.
