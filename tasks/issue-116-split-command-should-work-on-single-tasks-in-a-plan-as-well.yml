rmplan split should be able to split tasks in a plan into multiple subtasks by taking a fully qualified task ID like "1.3". When this happens insert the new tasks where the old task was.
This should be a new prompt similar to the existing split prompt, but optimized for splitting a single task in a plan into multiple tasks.
