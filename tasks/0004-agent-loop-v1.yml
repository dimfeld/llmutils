tasks:
  - title: Refactor 'done' command logic into a reusable function
    done: true
    description: Create actions.ts and move the core logic of finding the next
      pending task and marking steps/tasks as done into `findPendingTask` and
      `markStepDone` functions. Update the 'done' command to use this new
      function.
  - title: Refactor 'next' command logic into a reusable function
    done: true
    description: Move the core logic of preparing the next step (including finding
      files, building the prompt, and optionally calling rmfilter) into a
      `prepareNextStep` function in actions.ts. Add an option to disable
      interactive step selection. Update the 'next' command to use this
      function.
  - title: Add 'agent' command skeleton and loop structure
    done: true
    description: Add the basic 'agent <planFile>' command to tim.ts. Implement the
      main loop structure that loads the plan and iterates using
      `findPendingTask` until completion or error.
  - title: Integrate 'prepareNextStep' into the agent command
    done: true
    description: Call the `prepareNextStep` function from within the agent's loop.
      Configure it to use rmfilter and automatically select the first pending
      step. Capture the generated prompt file path.
  - title: Add 'rmrun' execution
    done: true
    description: Define and call a placeholder function `runAndApplyChanges` within
      the agent loop. This function runs the prompt (using rmfilter output) and
      applies changes, returning a success/failure status.
  - title: Integrate 'markStepDone' into the agent command
    done: true
    description: If the placeholder `runAndApplyChanges` succeeds, call
      `markStepDone` to mark the step as complete and commit the changes
      automatically.
  - title: Finalize 'agent' command with loop control and logging
    done: true
    description: Add proper loop termination conditions (plan completion or error),
      refine error handling for file operations and function calls, and ensure
      informative logging for user feedback throughout the process.

The agent command will automate the process of executing steps defined in an tim YAML file.
It will sequentially:
1. Prepare the next step using logic similar to `tim next --rmfilter` (selecting the first pending step automatically).
2. Execute the step using logic similar to an assumed `rmrun` command/function (implementation placeholder).
3. Mark the step as done using logic similar to `tim done --commit` if execution succeeds.
4. Repeat until all steps are completed.
This requires refactoring the `next` and `done` command logic into reusable functions placed in a new `actions.ts` file.
