The current `rmplan generate` command produces YAML directly, which is hard to review and edit.
This project updates the workflow:
1. `rmplan generate` will now prompt the LLM to create the plan in a structured Markdown format.
2. `rmplan extract` will take this Markdown, use a second LLM call (Gemini Flash) to convert it into the required YAML format, and then validate the result.
This makes the initial plan generation more user-friendly while automating the conversion to the structured YAML needed by downstream commands.
