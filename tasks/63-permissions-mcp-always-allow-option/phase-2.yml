goal: To introduce a specialized, interactive prompt for defining allowed
  prefixes for `Bash` commands when a user chooses the "Always Allow" option for
  them.

  title: Enhance Permissions MCP with an "Always Allow" Option and Bash Prefix
    Matching
  goal: To update the interactive permissions MCP, replacing the simple
    confirmation prompt with a more flexible system that allows users to
    permanently approve certain tool invocations, including support for
    fine-grained, prefix-based approvals for Bash commands.
  details: >-
    The current permission system requires users to manually approve or deny
    every tool invocation within a session, which can be repetitive. This
    project will enhance the user experience by introducing an "Always Allow"
    option.


    The key changes are:

    1.  Replacing the `confirm` (Yes/No) prompt with a `select` prompt offering
    "Allow", "Disallow", or "Always Allow".

    2.  If "Always Allow" is chosen, the system will remember this choice for
    the specific tool.

    3.  For `Bash` tools, selecting "Always Allow" will trigger a special
    interactive prompt where the user can define a safe command prefix (e.g.,
    `git status` or `npm run`) that will be automatically approved in the
    future.

    4.  These "Always Allow" rules will be persisted to a configuration file, so
    they are remembered across sessions.


    This feature will be implemented primarily within the `ClaudeCodeExecutor`
    in `src/tim/executors/claude_code.ts`, which handles the permission
    prompting logic.
tasks:
  - title: Create a Custom Interactive Prompt for Prefix Selection
    done: true
    description: Using the `@inquirer/core` library, develop a new custom prompt
      component. This component will display the `Bash` command and allow the
      user to select a prefix by moving a cursor word-by-word with the left and
      right arrow keys. It will also support a keybind ('a') to select the
      entire command string.
  - title: Enhance Storage and Integrate Bash Prefix Prompt
    done: true
    description: Modify the in-memory storage structure to accommodate the new
      `Bash` prefix rules and integrate the new custom prompt. This will require
      changing from a simple `Set` of tool names to a more complex `Map` that
      can store a list of approved prefixes for the `Bash` tool alongside other
      approved tool names.
  - title: Implement Prefix-Based Approval Logic for Bash Tools
    done: true
    description: Update the pre-prompt approval check. For incoming `Bash` tool
      requests, the logic must now compare the command's input against the list
      of stored, approved prefixes to determine if it can be automatically
      approved.

This phase builds on the "Always Allow" feature by adding the required special handling for `Bash` tools. When a user decides to always allow a `Bash` command, instead of approving the entire tool wholesale, they will be presented with a new custom prompt. This prompt will allow them to interactively select a prefix of the command to approve, providing more granular and safer control.
