# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimfeld/llmutils/main/schema/tim-plan-schema.json
goal: Enhance `tim` to support loading configuration from a YAML file,
  enabling customizable behavior, starting with post-apply commands for the
  agent.

  - title: Define Configuration Schema
    done: true
    description: Define the structure and validation rules for the `tim.yml`
      configuration file using Zod. This includes the initial
      `postApplyCommands` section with its nested properties.
  - title: Implement Configuration Loading Logic
    done: true
    description: Create functions to locate, read, parse, and validate the
      configuration file based on the defined schema. Handle default paths,
      command-line overrides, and file non-existence gracefully.
  - title: Add Command-Line Option
    done: true
    description: Add the `-c, --config` option to the main `tim` command using
      `commander` to allow users to specify a custom configuration file path.
  - title: Integrate Configuration Loading
    done: true
    description: Modify the `tim.ts` script to call the configuration loading
      logic early in the execution flow and make the loaded configuration
      available to the command actions, particularly the `agent` command.
  - title: Implement Post-Apply Command Execution
    done: true
    description: Modify the `agent` command loop to execute the configured
      `postApplyCommands` after changes are successfully applied by
      `runAndApplyChanges`. Handle command execution details like working
      directory, environment variables, and the `allowFailure` flag.

The `tim` tool currently operates without external configuration. This feature introduces the ability to read settings from a YAML file to customize its operation.

**Configuration File Location:**
1. Default: `.rmfilter/tim.yml` in the Git repository root.
2. Override: Specified via a new `-c, --config <path>` command-line option.
3. Absence: If neither the default nor a specified file exists, `tim` should proceed with default behavior without error.

**Configuration Schema (Initial):**
The configuration will be validated using Zod. Initially, it will support `postApplyCommands`:
```yaml
# Example .rmfilter/tim.yml
postApplyCommands:
  - title: Format Code # User-friendly title for logging
    command: bun fmt # The command to execute
    # workingDirectory: sub/directory # Optional, defaults to repo root
    # env: # Optional environment variables
    #   MY_VAR: value
    # allowFailure: true # Optional, defaults to false
  - title: Run Linters
    command: bun lint --fix
    allowFailure: false # Explicitly false (default)
```

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Define the Zod schema for the configuration.
2. Implement logic to find and load the configuration file (handling default path, override path, and non-existence).
3. Add the `--config` option to the main `tim` command.
4. Integrate config loading into the `tim` startup sequence.
5. Modify the `agent` command to execute the `postApplyCommands` after successfully applying changes via `runAndApplyChanges` but before marking the step as done.
6. Ensure robust error handling (e.g., invalid YAML, schema validation errors, command execution failures based on `allowFailure`).
