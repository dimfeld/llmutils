  Add a --query option to rmfind that will filter the found files using a natural language query. Gather the files together and pass their contents and the
  query to the language model, using a model generated from the model_factory and the vercel ai sdk to generate a list of files that look relevant.
  Use the `google/gemini-2.0-flash` model string by default.
