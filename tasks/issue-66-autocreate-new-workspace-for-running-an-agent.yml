# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimfeld/llmutils/main/schema/rmplan-plan-schema.json
goal: Implement a feature to automatically create a new workspace (Git clone or
  worktree) for running an `rmplan` agent, based on repository-level
  configuration. This includes managing the workspace lifecycle, customizing its
  location, and tracking its association with a specific task.

The project involves several key areas:
1.  **Configuration:** Enhancing the `rmplan.yml` schema to define how new workspaces should be created. This includes options for using a custom script or having `llmutils` manage the cloning and setup process.
2.  **Workspace Management:** A new `WorkspaceManager` service will encapsulate the logic for creating workspaces. This service will handle both script-based and `llmutils`-managed creation, including cloning, branch creation, and running initialization commands.
3.  **Tracking:** A system for recording which task a workspace was created for, likely using a global JSON file (`~/.llmutils/workspaces.json`).
4.  **Agent Integration:** Modifying the `rmplan agent` command to utilize the `WorkspaceManager`. The agent will operate within the newly created workspace, ensuring that all file operations and Git commands are contextually correct.
5.  **Customization:** Allowing users to specify the location for new clones and define repository-specific initialization steps.

The implementation will be broken down into iterative tasks, focusing on building the core components first (configuration, workspace manager basics) and then integrating them into the existing `rmplan agent` workflow.
