tasks:
  - title: 1. Setup Test Environment and `SharedStore` Context/Scratchpad Tests
    done: true
    description: >
      This task focuses on setting up the testing environment (assuming Jest)
      and writing the first set of unit tests for the `SharedStore` class. These
      initial tests will cover context and scratchpad management. A mock
      `PersistenceAdapter` will also be defined for use in `SharedStore` tests.
  - title: 2. `SharedStore` Event Queue and History Tests
    done: true
    description: >
      This task continues testing `SharedStore` by focusing on its event queue
      management (`enqueueEvents`, `processEvents`, `getPendingEvents`,
      `dequeueEvent`) and history/tracing features (`logTransition`,
      `getCurrentState`, `setCurrentState`, `getExecutionTrace`, `exportTrace`).
  - title: 3. `SharedStore` Persistence, Rollback, and Retry Tests
    done: true
    description: >
      This task tests `SharedStore`'s persistence capabilities using the mock
      adapter, and its `withRollback` and `retry` mechanisms. This will also
      involve checking that telemetry calls (mocked for now) within these
      methods are made.
  - title: 4. `telemetry.ts` Utility Function Tests and Basic Telemetry Setup
    done: true
    description: >
      This task involves writing unit tests for utility functions in
      `src/state_machine/telemetry.ts` like `flattenAttributes`,
      `objectToSpanAttributeValues`, and `toSpanAttributeValue`. It also
      includes setting up the actual OpenTelemetry SDK with an
      `InMemorySpanExporter` for more comprehensive telemetry testing in later
      tasks, instead of relying solely on mocks for `withSpan`.
  - title: 5. Basic `Node` Tests (Lifecycle and Error Handling)
    done: true
    description: >
      This task focuses on testing the abstract `Node` class. Since `Node` is
      abstract, we'll need to create a concrete implementation for testing.
      Tests will cover the `run` method, including the `prep`, `exec`, `post`
      lifecycle, error handling, and interactions with`SharedStore` (retry,
      rollback). We will also start using the telemetry test setup from Task 4
      to verify spans created by `Node.run`.
  - title: 6. `StateMachine` Initialization and Basic Transitions
    done: true
    description: >
      This task begins testing the `StateMachine` class. It covers
      initialization, loading persisted state (using a mock adapter), and
      processing a single event that leads to a simple state transition. We'll
      verify state changes, context updates, and basic telemetry.
  - title: 7. `StateMachine` Event Handling, Multiple Transitions, and Terminal States
    done: true
    description: >
      This task expands `StateMachine` tests to cover scenarios with multiple
      events, sequences of transitions, and handling of `waiting` and `terminal`
      state results.
  - title: 8. `StateMachine` Error Handling and Retries
    done: true
    description: >
      This task focuses on testing the `StateMachine`'s error handling
      capabilities. This includes errors originating from nodes, node-specific
      `onError` handlers, machine-level `config.onError` handlers, transitions
      to the configured `errorState`, and the retry mechanism defined in
      `StateMachineConfig`.
  - title: 9. `StateMachine` Persistence Integration
    done: true
    description: >
      This task tests the integration of persistence with the `StateMachine`. It
      involves verifying that the state is correctly saved to (and loaded from)
      the `PersistenceAdapter` during the state machine's lifecycle.
  - title: 10. `StateMachine` Hooks
    done: true
    description: >
      This task is dedicated to testing the various hooks provided by
      `StateMachine`: `onTransition`, `onActions` (if its TODO is resolved or
      testing current behavior), `onError`, and `onRetry`.
  - title: 11. `FlowNode` Tests and Integration
    done: true
    description: >
      This task tests the `FlowNode` class, which manages a nested state
      machine. Tests will cover event/action translation, sub-machine execution,
      persistence of sub-machine state in the scratchpad, and integration of
      `FlowNode` within a parent `StateMachine`.
  - title: 12. Advanced Telemetry Verification
    done: true
    description: >
      Using the OpenTelemetry SDK setup with `InMemorySpanExporter` (from Task
      4), this task focuses on performing more detailed verification of emitted
      spans, attributes, and events across `StateMachine`, `Node`, and
      `SharedStore` operations.
  - title: 13. Documentation Update
    done: true
    description: >
      Update `src/state_machine/README.md` to include information about the
      newly created test suite, how to run the tests, and any other relevant
      details for developers regarding testing the state machine functionality.

The project aims to create a suite of unit and integration tests using a test-driven development (TDD) approach. The tests will cover all major aspects of the state machine:
- Core logic of `SharedStore` (context, scratchpad, events, history, persistence, rollback, retry).
- `Node` lifecycle (`prep`, `exec`, `post`), error handling, and interaction with `SharedStore`.
- `FlowNode` behavior, including sub-machine management and event/action translation.
- `StateMachine` operations: initialization, event processing, state transitions, error handling, retries, persistence integration, and hooks.
- Telemetry generation: ensuring correct spans, attributes, and events are emitted for observability.

We will use Jest (or a similar testing framework) and create mocks for external dependencies like the `PersistenceAdapter`. For telemetry, we will leverage the `@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base` with an `InMemorySpanExporter` to capture and verify emitted telemetry data. The tests will be broken down into small, incremental tasks, building upon each other to achieve full coverage.
