goal: Enhance rmfilter to automatically discover and include relevant .mdc
  (Markdown Domain Configuration) files based on rules defined within the MDC
  files themselves (matching globs or grep terms against active source files),
  including files without specific rules by default. Provide an option to
  disable this feature and update the output format for included documentation
  and rules. Use Bun.file for file operations where appropriate.

tasks:
  - title: 1. Setup MDC Parsing and Discovery Utilities
    done: true
    description: Create utility functions to find .mdc files in the specified
      locations and parse their frontmatter and content using `Bun.file`. Add a
      new command-line flag `--no-mdc`.
  - title: 2. Implement MDC Filtering Logic (Updated)
    done: true
    description: Create the logic that filters parsed MDC files. Files without
      `globs` or `grep` are included by default. Otherwise, inclusion depends on
      `globs` matching active source files or `grep` matching active source file
      content (read via `Bun.file`).
  - title: 3. Update Output Formatting for Docs and Rules
    done: true
    description: Modify `getAdditionalDocs` to accept processed MDC files and
      generate the output using the new `<documents>` and `<rules>` XML
      structure. Ensure existing `--docs` and `--rules` flags still work and use
      the new format.
  - title: 4. Integrate MDC Processing into Main Workflow
    done: true
    description: Modify `rmfilter.ts` to orchestrate the MDC discovery, parsing,
      filtering, and integration with the final output generation, respecting
      the `--no-mdc` flag.

The project involves several interconnected parts:
1.  **MDC Discovery:** Locating `.mdc` files in standard project locations (`.cursor/rules/`) and a user-specific location (`~/.config/rmfilter/rules`).
2.  **MDC Parsing:** Reading `.mdc` files using `Bun.file` and parsing their frontmatter (YAML) to extract metadata like `description`, `globs`, `grep`, and `type`.
3.  **Filtering Logic:** Implementing the core mechanism to determine if an MDC file should be included. This involves:
    *   Checking if the MDC file lacks *both* `globs` and `grep` specifiers (include by default).
    *   Matching the MDC `globs` against the set of *active source files* selected by `rmfilter`.
    *   Matching the MDC `grep` terms (case-insensitively) against the *content* of the active source files (read using `Bun.file`).
4.  **Integration:** Connecting the discovery, parsing, and filtering logic into the main `rmfilter` execution flow. The filtering needs access to the final set of source files selected by the user's commands.
5.  **Output Formatting:** Modifying `additional_docs.ts` to structure the included documents and rules using `<documents>`/`<rules>` parent tags and individual `<document>`/`<rule>` child tags, potentially with a `description` attribute.
6.  **Configuration:** Adding a `--no-mdc` command-line flag to disable the automatic MDC inclusion.

We will use libraries like `fast-glob` for finding files, `gray-matter` for parsing frontmatter, and `micromatch` for glob matching.
