This feature allows `tim next` to automatically include imported files relevant to the current task, similar to `rmfilter`.

When `tim next` is run with `--with-imports` or `--with-all-imports`:
1. It will first attempt to extract file references mentioned directly within the generated LLM prompt text for the step.
2. If no files are found in the prompt, it will fall back to using the `files` list defined in the current task of the plan YAML.
3. If the `--rmfilter` option is also used, these candidate files and the corresponding import flag (`--with-imports` or `--with-all-imports`) will be passed as a separate command block (`-- <files> <flag>`) to the `rmfilter` process. The original task files will *not* be passed directly in the main arguments.
4. If `--rmfilter` is *not* used, `tim` will perform the import analysis itself using `ImportWalker`, expand the file list, deduplicate it, and include the full list in the generated prompt context.
