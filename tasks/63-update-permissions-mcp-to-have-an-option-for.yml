Replace the `confirm` with a `select` with options for Allow, Disallow, or Always Allow

If Always Allow is selected, then remember that this tool type is always allowed.

If Always Allow is selected on a Bash tool invocation, then we should allow a specific prefix substring of the command. We need some way to easily specify what prefix is allowed.
