project:
  title: Implement Interactive Permissions for Claude Code Executor
  goal: Allow the user to respond to tool permissions requests when using the
    Claude Code executor.
  details: This project will add support for the Claude Code SDK's permissions MCP
    (Model Context Protocol). A new MCP server will be implemented to handle
    permission requests by prompting the user for confirmation. This feature
    will be configurable via a new flag in `claudeCodeOptionsSchema` and an
    environment variable. When enabled, the executor will dynamically generate
    the necessary MCP configuration and launch the Claude Code CLI with the
    appropriate settings to enable interactive tool-use permissions.
tasks:
  - title: Create the Permissions MCP Server File
    done: true
    description: Create a new file at
      `src/rmplan/executors/claude_code/permissions_mcp.ts` to house the logic
      for the permissions server.
  - title: Implement the MCP Server and Input Schema
    done: true
    description: In the new `permissions_mcp.ts` file, set up the basic structure
      for an MCP server using the `@modelcontextprotocol/server` package. Define
      a `zod` schema to validate the incoming permission request data, which
      includes `tool_name` and `input`.
  - title: Implement the Interactive Approval Prompt Tool
    done: true
    description: Define an `approval_prompt` tool within the MCP server. This tool's
      handler will receive the permission request, format the `tool_name` and
      `input` as a human-readable YAML string, and display it to the user. It
      will then use `@inquirer/prompts` to present a confirmation prompt asking
      for permission to proceed.
  - title: Implement MCP Response Logic
    done: true
    description: 'Based on the boolean result from the `inquirer` prompt, construct
      the appropriate response payload. The response must be a JSON string
      containing either `{ "behavior": "allow", "updatedInput": ... }` or `{
      "behavior": "deny", "message": ... }` as required by the Claude Code SDK.'

This phase focuses on creating the core component: the permissions server. This script will run as a separate process managed by the Claude Code SDK. It will define a specific tool (`approval_prompt`) that the SDK calls when a tool needs permission to run. The script will be responsible for parsing the request, presenting it clearly to the user, and returning a formatted response based on the user's input.
