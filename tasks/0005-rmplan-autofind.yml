This plan involves two main parts:
1. Refactor the `rmfind` tool by separating its core file-finding logic from the command-line interface (CLI) wrapper. This will allow the core logic to be imported and used by other tools like `tim`.
2. Enhance the `tim next` command by adding an `--autofind` option. When used, this option will invoke the refactored `rmfind` core logic using the current plan task's details as a query. The files found by `rmfind` will then be automatically included in the list of relevant files, particularly when generating context for `rmfilter`.
