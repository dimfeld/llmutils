title: Implement and Test Issue Field Population
goal: To fix the bug preventing issue URLs from being added to multi-phase plans
  and to add robust testing for this feature.

  title: Set issue field in plan files when generating from a GitHub issue
  goal: The goal of this project is to ensure that when a plan is generated using
    the `rmplan generate --issue` command, the resulting YAML plan file(s)
    correctly include the URL of the source GitHub issue in their `issue` field.
  details: When a user generates a plan from a GitHub issue, it's important to
    maintain a link back to that issue for context and traceability. The
    `PlanSchema` already supports an `issue` field for this purpose. Currently,
    the logic to pass the issue URL from the `generate` command to the plan
    creation functions is partially implemented. It works correctly for
    single-phase plans but is broken for multi-phase plans. The `rmplan
    generate` command correctly fetches the issue URL and passes it in the
    `ExtractMarkdownToYamlOptions`. The `extractMarkdownToYaml` function in
    `src/rmplan/process_markdown.ts` correctly handles this for single-phase
    plans. However, the `saveMultiPhaseYaml` function in the same file has a bug
    where it ignores the passed-in issue URLs, leaving the `issue` field empty
    in multi-phase plan files. This project will fix the bug in the multi-phase
    generation logic and add comprehensive tests to ensure both single and
    multi-phase plan generation scenarios correctly populate the `issue` field.
tasks:
  - title: Correctly propagate issue URLs in multi-phase plan generation
    done: false
    description: The `saveMultiPhaseYaml` function in
      `src/rmplan/process_markdown.ts` currently ignores the issue URLs passed
      to it. This task involves modifying the function to correctly use the
      `options.issueUrls` and populate the `issue` field for each generated
      phase file.
  - title: Add tests for setting the issue field in generated plans
    done: false
    description: Create tests to verify that the `issue` field is correctly
      populated when generating a plan from a GitHub issue. This should cover
      both the single-phase and multi-phase plan generation scenarios. The tests
      will need to mock the GitHub API and LLM responses to provide predictable
      data and assert that the generated YAML files contain the expected issue
      URL.

This phase will address the core bug in `saveMultiPhaseYaml` and then build out the necessary tests to verify the functionality for both single and multi-phase plans. This ensures that any plan generated from a GitHub issue, regardless of its structure, will contain the correct reference back to the issue.
