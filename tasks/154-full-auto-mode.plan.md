Might not do this but eventually it will be useful. Better to focus on more GUI-based kickoff while keeping interactive
generate and review and such for now.

Automated mode that does:
- new workspace or lock existing available one (should be an option just like with `workspace add`)
- Git fetch using git/jj
- new branch off of main, name autogenerated from plan title and ID and issue URL if present (this logic already exists I think, just need to reuse it)
- If the plan has no tasks, then "Generate" without the question part of the prompt so that it completes all in one go without interaction.
- Check if tasks are filled in. If not run another prompt specifically to read the implementation guide from the plan
and add a task for each step
- Run the plan
- Run review command and add found issues as tasks to the plan. Then run `agent` command again to implement them. Do this until the review is ACCEPTABLE or up to 5 times.
- Make a commit every time we add review tasks so that it's clear where a review fix step started, and list which tasks
were added
- Push branch and create draft PR -- use claude code to create the PR description
- If we ran 5 times without ACCEPTABLE then make sure that the PR description notes that
- Unlock workspace if we got through to the end and pushed the branch
- At the end, print the name and path of the workspace used.



This command should be able to start from any step and skip steps that don't need to be done, eg if plan has tasks then don't generate 
- in the final review step, should add the review issues as tasks and execute them that way so it's easier to see what was done there
