Automated mode that does:
- new workspace or lock existing available one (should be an option just like with `workspace add`)
- Git fetch using git/jj
- new branch off of main, name autogenerated from plan title and ID and issue URL if present (this logic already exists I think, just need to reuse it)
- "Generate" without the question part of the prompt so that it one-shots. The existing `generate` command should be
updated for this to work more like the MCP version of the prompt where it lets the agent write the research and guide to
the plan file.
- Check if tasks are filled in. If not run another prompt specifically to read the implementation guide from the plan
and add a task for each step
- Run the plan
- Run review command and autofix until ACCEPTABLE or up to 5 times.
- Push branch and create draft PR -- use claude code to create the PR description
- If we ran 5 times without ACCEPTABLE then make sure that the PR description notes that and includes the last round of review messages that we did not try to address
- Unlock workspace if we got through to the end and pushed the branch
