## Overview

Extend the `rmplan set` command to support the new `discoveredFrom` field, allowing agents to mark plans with their discovery source.

## Changes Required

File: `src/rmplan/commands/set.ts`

Add two new options:
```typescript
.option('--discovered-from <planId>', 'Set the plan this was discovered from', (value) => {
  const n = Number(value);
  if (Number.isNaN(n) || n <= 0) {
    throw new Error(`discovered-from must be a positive integer, saw ${value}`);
  }
  return n;
})
.option('--no-discovered-from', 'Remove the discoveredFrom association')
```

In the handler function, add:
```typescript
if (options.discoveredFrom !== undefined) {
  updates.discoveredFrom = options.discoveredFrom;
} else if (options.noDiscoveredFrom) {
  updates.discoveredFrom = undefined;
}
```

## Example Usage

```bash
# Mark that plan 42 was discovered while working on plan 38
rmplan set 42 --discovered-from 38

# Remove the discovery link
rmplan set 42 --no-discovered-from
```

## Testing

- Set discoveredFrom on a plan, verify with `rmplan show`
- Remove discoveredFrom, verify it's gone
- Try invalid values (negative, non-integer), expect errors
- Verify that `rmplan show` displays the "Discovered From" section correctly

## Dependencies

Depends on plan 129 which adds the `discoveredFrom` schema field.

## MCP Integration

This will be covered by the comprehensive MCP tools plan (plan 138) which will add an `update-plan-properties` or `set-plan-fields` tool that can update any plan metadata field including `discoveredFrom`.

The tool would accept:
```typescript
{
  plan: string,
  discoveredFrom?: number | null,  // null to remove
  priority?: string,
  status?: string,
  // ... other fields
}
```

This provides agents the same capability as `rmplan set --discovered-from`.

# Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented discoveredFrom support for rmplan set command, allowing agents to mark plans with their discovery source. Modified src/rmplan/rmplan.ts to add --discovered-from and --no-discovered-from CLI options with validation for positive integers. Modified src/rmplan/commands/set.ts to handle setting and removing the discoveredFrom field, following the same pattern as other optional fields like parent. Added comprehensive test coverage in set.test.ts with 4 new tests covering setting, removing, and changing discoveredFrom values. Fixed validation bug during verification that allowed decimal values - added Number.isInteger check. All quality gates passed: type checking, linting, and 2269 tests all pass. Integration works seamlessly with plan schema from plan 129 and show command from plan 130.
