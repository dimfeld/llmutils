```

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test each component in isolation
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Aim for 80%+ coverage

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test component interactions
   - Use real Git repositories
   - Test with GitHub API

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Test complete workflows
   - Use test GitHub repos
   - Verify all outputs

### Monitoring and Telemetry

1. **Metrics to Track**
   - Workflow success rates
   - Processing times
   - API usage
   - Error rates

2. **Logging**
   - Structured logging
   - Trace IDs for workflows
   - Error categorization
   - Performance metrics

### Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**
   - Secure token storage
   - Minimal permissions
   - Regular rotation

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data
   - Scrub logs
   - Limit data retention

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Respect GitHub limits
   - Implement backoff
   - Queue management

## Rollout Plan
