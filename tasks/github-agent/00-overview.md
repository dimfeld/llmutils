# GitHub Agent Enhancement Overview

This directory contains implementation plans for transforming rmapp into a full-featured GitHub coding agent capable of:

1. **Implementing issues autonomously** - Creating branches, generating code, and opening PRs
2. **Responding to PR reviews** - Making requested changes based on review comments
3. **Managing workflows** - Tracking state across multiple issues and PRs
4. **Learning from patterns** - Improving over time based on codebase conventions

## Plan Documents

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- `01-state-management.md` - Database and state tracking system
- `02-workflow-engine.md` - Core workflow execution engine
- `03-enhanced-commands.md` - New command system and parser

### Phase 2: Issue Implementation
- `04-issue-analyzer.md` - Extract requirements from issues
- `05-plan-generator.md` - Generate rmplan from issues
- `06-pr-creator.md` - Automated PR creation with descriptions

### Phase 3: PR Review Handling
- `07-review-parser.md` - Parse and understand review comments
- `08-code-locator.md` - Map comments to code locations
- `09-review-responder.md` - Apply changes and respond to reviews

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- `10-batch-operations.md` - Handle multiple issues/PRs
- `11-context-gathering.md` - Smart context and documentation
- `12-learning-system.md` - Pattern recognition and improvement

## Architecture Principles

1. **Build on existing infrastructure** - Leverage rmplan, workspace manager, and executors
2. **Maintain backwards compatibility** - Current rmapp functionality remains unchanged
3. **Fail gracefully** - Clear error messages and recovery mechanisms
4. **Transparent progress** - Users can always see what the agent is doing
5. **Extensible design** - Easy to add new capabilities

## Implementation Order

1. Start with state management (enables everything else)
2. Implement basic issue workflow (create branch → implement → PR)
3. Add PR review handling (parse → apply → respond)
4. Layer on advanced features (batching, learning)

## Success Metrics

- Can implement simple issues end-to-end without human intervention
- Can apply straightforward review feedback (add comments, error handling, etc.)
- Maintains context across multiple interactions
- Generates code that follows project conventions
