title: Allow Claude Code to delete files it created - Implement Core File
  Tracking and Auto-Approval Logic
goal: To implement the fundamental mechanism for tracking created/modified files
  and auto-approving their deletion, without the user-facing configuration.

  - title: Add a file tracking set to the executor state
    description: A new `Set` will be added to the code executor's session state to
      store the absolute paths of files that have been written to or edited.
      This set will be initialized as empty at the beginning of each execution
      session.

  - title: Track file paths written by `Write`, `Edit`, and `MultiEdit`
    description: |
      The formatJsonMessage function currently parses tool use requests from
      Claude Code and formats them as text to output. This function should be modified
      so that it also returns the file paths referenced by those tools, and the code
      that calls formatJsonMessage should be modified to handle that new return type.
    steps: []
  - title: Implement `rm` command parsing in the permission handler
    description: Logic will be added to the `bash` tool's permission handler to
      parse the command string. This logic will specifically identify `rm
      <path>` and `rm -f <path>` commands and extract the file path argument.
    steps: []
  - title: Implement auto-approval for tracked file deletions
    description: The `Bash` permission handler will be updated to use the new
      parsing logic. If a command is identified as a file deletion, the handler
      will check if the extracted file path exists in the tracked files set. If
      it does, the handler will immediately return an "Allow" decision,
      bypassing the standard user prompt.

This phase focuses on building the core functionality. We will introduce a stateful set within the executor to keep track of file paths touched by file-writing tools. We will then modify the permission-handling logic for the `bash` tool to recognize `rm` commands and check them against this set, auto-approving if a match is found. For this phase, the feature will be treated as always-on to simplify development and testing.
