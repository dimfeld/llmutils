  - title: Add a file tracking set to the executor state
    description: >
      A new `Set<string>` will be added to the ClaudeCodeExecutor class to store
      the absolute paths of files that have been written to or edited. This set
      will be initialized as empty at the beginning of each execution session
      and will persist throughout the session to track all file operations. The
      set should be stored as a private property in the class and initialized in
      the constructor or at the start of the execute method.
    files:
      - src/rmplan/executors/claude_code.ts
      - src/rmplan/executors/claude_code.test.ts
    steps:
      - prompt: >
          Create a test file for ClaudeCodeExecutor if it doesn't exist, and add
          tests that verify

          a trackedFiles Set property exists and is properly initialized when
          the executor is created.
        done: true
      - prompt: >
          Add a private property `trackedFiles: Set<string>` to the
          ClaudeCodeExecutor class

          and initialize it as an empty Set in the constructor.
        done: true
      - prompt: >
          Update the execute method to ensure the trackedFiles set is cleared at
          the beginning

          of each execution session for proper state isolation between runs.
        done: true
  - title: Track file paths written by Write, Edit, and MultiEdit
    description: >
      The formatJsonMessage function currently parses tool use requests from
      Claude Code and formats them as text to output. This function should be
      modified so that it also returns the file paths referenced by those tools.
      The function signature should change to return an object containing both
      the formatted message and an array of file paths. The code in
      claude_code.ts that calls formatJsonMessage should be updated to handle
      this new return type and add any extracted file paths to the trackedFiles
      set.
    files:
      - src/rmplan/executors/claude_code/format.ts
      - src/rmplan/executors/claude_code.ts
    steps:
      - prompt: >
          Modify the formatJsonMessage function to return an object with {
          message?: string, filePaths?: string[] }

          instead of just a string. Extract file_path from Write, Edit, and
          MultiEdit tool invocations.
        done: false
      - prompt: >
          For MultiEdit tool invocations, ensure all file paths from the edits
          array are extracted

          since MultiEdit can operate on multiple files in a single invocation.
        done: false
      - prompt: >
          Update the caller of formatJsonMessage in claude_code.ts to
          destructure the new return value

          and add any extracted file paths to the trackedFiles set using
          absolute path resolution.
        done: false
  - title: Implement rm command parsing in the permission handler
    description: >
      Logic will be added to parse Bash commands and identify file deletion
      operations. This parser should recognize various forms of rm commands
      including `rm <path>`, `rm -f <path>`, `rm -rf <path>`, and handle edge
      cases like quoted paths. The parser should extract the file path
      argument(s) from the command string and return them in a normalized form.
    files:
      - src/rmplan/executors/claude_code.ts
    steps:
      - prompt: >
          Create a private method parseRmCommand(command: string) that uses
          regex or string parsing

          to identify rm commands and extract file paths, handling flags like
          -f, -r, -rf.
        done: false
      - prompt: >
          Ensure the parser handles quoted paths correctly (both single and
          double quotes) and

          normalizes relative paths to absolute paths using the current working
          directory.
        done: false
      - prompt: >
          Add unit tests for the parseRmCommand method to verify it correctly
          handles various

          rm command formats and edge cases like spaces in paths and multiple
          file arguments.
        done: false
  - title: Implement auto-approval for tracked file deletions
    description: >
      The Bash tool permission handler in createPermissionSocketServer will be
      updated to use the new parsing logic. When a permission request comes in
      for the Bash tool, it will check if the command is a file deletion
      operation using the rm command parser. If it is, it will extract the file
      path and check if it exists in the trackedFiles set. If the file path
      matches a tracked file, the handler will immediately return an approval
      without prompting the user, allowing Claude Code to seamlessly delete
      files it created.
    files:
      - src/rmplan/executors/claude_code.ts
      - src/rmplan/executors/claude_code.test.ts
    steps:
      - prompt: >
          Modify the permission request handler in createPermissionSocketServer
          to check if

          tool_name is 'Bash' and use parseRmCommand to extract file paths from
          the command.
        done: false
      - prompt: >
          If rm file paths are found, check each against the trackedFiles set
          and auto-approve

          the command if all paths are tracked files, logging the auto-approval
          action.
        done: false
      - prompt: >
          Add integration tests that verify the end-to-end flow: track a file
          via Write/Edit,

          then confirm that rm commands for that file are auto-approved without
          user prompts.

This phase focuses on building the core functionality. We will introduce a stateful set within the executor to keep track of file paths touched by file-writing tools. We will then modify the permission-handling logic for the `bash` tool to recognize `rm` commands and check them against this set, auto-approving if a match is found. For this phase, the feature will be treated as always-on to simplify development and testing.
