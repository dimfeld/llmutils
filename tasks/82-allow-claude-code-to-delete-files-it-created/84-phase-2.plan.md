tasks:
  - title: Add a configuration option to enable or disable auto-approval
    description: The code executor's configuration structure will be updated to
      include a new optional boolean property, `autoApproveCreatedFileDeletion`, which
      will default to `false` to maintain backward compatibility and safe
      defaults.
    steps: []
  - title: Connect the configuration flag to the auto-approval logic
    description: The auto-approval logic implemented in Phase 1 will be wrapped in a
      conditional check. The system will now only attempt to auto-approve a
      deletion if `autoApproveCreatedFileDeletion` is set to `true` in the executor's
      configuration.
    steps: []
  - title: Implement logging for auto-approved deletions
    description: 'A log statement will be added to the permission handler. When a
      file deletion is successfully auto-approved, a message such as
      "Auto-approving rm command for file created by Claude: <path>" will be
      printed to the console or the configured logger.'
    steps: []
  - title: Update tests to cover the configuration flag
    description: The integration tests from Phase 1 will be expanded. New test cases
      will be added to verify that the feature is disabled by default and that
      it can be enabled and disabled correctly via the new configuration flag.
    steps: []
  - title: Update project documentation
    description: The `README.md` file or other relevant documentation will be
      updated to describe the new `autoApproveCreatedFileDeletion` configuration
      option. The documentation will explain its purpose, default value, and how
      to use it.

Building on the core logic from Phase 1, this phase will introduce a formal configuration flag, `autoApproveCreatedFileDeletion`, to enable or disable the feature. The auto-approval logic will be made conditional on this flag. We will also add a log message that is printed whenever a deletion is auto-approved, ensuring the user is aware of the action. Finally, we will update the project's documentation to inform users about the new feature.
