  - title: Add a configuration option to enable or disable auto-approval
    description: >
      The code executor's configuration structure will be updated to include a
      new optional boolean property, `autoApproveCreatedFileDeletion`, which
      will default to `false` to maintain backward compatibility and safe
      defaults. This property will be added to the claudeCodeOptionsSchema in
      schemas.ts, following the existing pattern used for other optional
      configuration properties like `permissionsMcp`.
    files:
      - src/rmplan/executors/schemas.ts
    steps:
      - prompt: >
          Add a new optional boolean property `autoApproveCreatedFileDeletion`
          to the claudeCodeOptionsSchema object.

          The property should default to false and include a descriptive comment
          explaining its purpose.

          Follow the existing pattern used for other optional boolean properties
          in the schema.
        done: true
  - title: Connect the configuration flag to the auto-approval logic
    description: >
      The auto-approval logic implemented in Phase 1 (lines 285-315 of
      claude_code.ts) will be wrapped in a conditional check. The system will
      now only attempt to auto-approve a deletion if
      `autoApproveCreatedFileDeletion` is set to `true` in the executor's
      configuration. This ensures the feature is opt-in and maintains backward
      compatibility with existing configurations.
    files:
      - src/rmplan/executors/claude_code.ts
    steps:
      - prompt: >
          Locate the auto-approval logic for tracked file deletions in the
          createPermissionSocketServer method (around lines 285-315).

          Wrap this entire block in a conditional check that verifies
          `this.options.autoApproveCreatedFileDeletion === true`.

          Ensure the logic falls through to the existing permission flow when
          the flag is false or undefined.
        done: false
  - title: Implement logging for auto-approved deletions
    description: >
      A log statement already exists in the permission handler at line 301-305.
      When a file deletion is successfully auto-approved, it prints
      "Auto-approving rm command for tracked file(s): <paths>" using
      chalk.green. This task involves verifying the existing logging is
      sufficient and matches the requirements.
    files: []
    steps:
      - prompt: >
          Verify that the existing log statement at line 301-305 in
          claude_code.ts properly logs auto-approved deletions.

          The message format should be "Auto-approving rm command for tracked
          file(s): <comma-separated paths>".

          No changes should be needed as the logging was already implemented
          correctly in Phase 1.
        done: false
  - title: Update tests to cover the configuration flag
    description: >
      The integration tests from Phase 1 will be expanded. New test cases will
      be added to verify that the feature is disabled by default and that it can
      be enabled and disabled correctly via the new configuration flag. Tests
      should cover scenarios where the flag is true, false, and undefined to
      ensure proper default behavior.
    files:
      - src/rmplan/executors/claude_code.test.ts
    steps:
      - prompt: >
          Add a new test case that verifies auto-approval is disabled when
          autoApproveCreatedFileDeletion is false.

          The test should set up tracked files, create a permission request for
          deleting them, and verify that

          auto-approval does not occur (the request goes through normal
          permission flow).
        done: false
      - prompt: >
          Add a test case that verifies auto-approval is disabled by default
          when the configuration option is not specified.

          This ensures backward compatibility for existing configurations that
          don't include the new flag.
        done: false
      - prompt: >
          Add a test case that verifies auto-approval works when
          autoApproveCreatedFileDeletion is explicitly set to true.

          This should reuse the existing auto-approval test logic but explicitly
          set the configuration flag.
        done: false
      - prompt: >
          Update any existing auto-approval tests to explicitly set
          autoApproveCreatedFileDeletion to true,

          since the feature will now be disabled by default.
        done: false
  - title: Update project documentation
    description: >
      The README.md file will be updated to describe the new
      `autoApproveCreatedFileDeletion` configuration option. The documentation
      will explain its purpose, default value, and how to use it. This should be
      added to the Claude Code Executor section, following the existing
      documentation pattern for other executor configuration options.
    files:
      - README.md
    steps:
      - prompt: >
          Locate the Claude Code Executor section in the README.md file.

          Add documentation for the new autoApproveCreatedFileDeletion
          configuration option.

          Include an example YAML configuration snippet showing how to enable
          the feature.

          Explain that this allows Claude Code to automatically delete files it
          created without prompting.

Building on the core logic from Phase 1, this phase will introduce a formal configuration flag, `autoApproveCreatedFileDeletion`, to enable or disable the feature. The auto-approval logic will be made conditional on this flag. We will also add a log message that is printed whenever a deletion is auto-approved, ensuring the user is aware of the action. Finally, we will update the project's documentation to inform users about the new feature.
