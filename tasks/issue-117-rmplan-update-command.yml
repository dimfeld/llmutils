title: rmplan update command
goal: "Implement: rmplan update command"
details: >-
  This should take a plan and a description of the update to do (from the
  command line or from the editor) and submit the existing plan and related
  files along with the description to a model.


  This is very similar to the generate  command except that it's including the
  already generated tasks and asking the model to update them. 



  Then go through the same yaml extract process and write the updated file back.
