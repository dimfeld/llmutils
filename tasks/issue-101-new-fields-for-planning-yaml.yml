# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimfeld/llmutils/main/schema/tim-plan-schema.json
goal: Implement new metadata fields for `tim` YAML files, including `id`,
  `status`, `priority`, timestamps, and fields for tracking issues, pull
  requests, and changed files. This involves updating the plan schema,
  initializing these fields when a plan is created from Markdown, and managing
  their state during plan execution by the agent.

    description: Refine `parseCommandOptionsFromComment` in

The project aims to enhance `tim`'s capabilities by adding structured metadata to its YAML plan files. This will enable better tracking, organization, and automation of tasks.

**Key changes include:**

1.  **Schema Update:** The `PlanSchema` (in `src/tim/planSchema.ts`) will be extended to include the new fields:
    *   `id`: A unique base36 timestamp (epoch 2025-05-01) for the plan file.
    *   `status`: Tracks the plan's lifecycle (`pending`, `in progress`, `done`).
    *   `priority`: Optional field for task prioritization (`unknown`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `urgent`).
    *   `dependencies`: Optional array of IDs of other task files.
    *   `baseBranch`: Optional branch name this plan builds upon.
    *   `changedFiles`: Optional array of files modified by this task.
    *   `rmfilter`: Optional array of `rmfilter` arguments for detailed planning context.
    *   `issue`: Optional array of URLs to relevant GitHub issues.
    *   `pullRequest`: Optional array of URLs to associated pull requests.
    *   `planGeneratedAt`, `promptsGeneratedAt`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`: Timestamp fields.

2.  **Metadata Initialization:**
    *   When a plan is generated from Markdown (via `tim extract` or `tim generate` without `--no-extract`), the `extractMarkdownToYaml` function in `src/tim/actions.ts` will initialize these new fields.
    *   `id` will be generated using a custom base36 timestamp function.
    *   Timestamps (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `planGeneratedAt`, `promptsGeneratedAt`) will be set to the current time.
    *   `status` will default to `pending`.
    *   `priority` will default to `unknown`.
    *   `issue` will be populated if the `--issue` flag was used during `tim generate`.
    *   `rmfilter` will be populated from `rmfilter:` comments in the issue text and any passthrough `rmfilter` arguments to `tim generate`.

3.  **Runtime Updates by `tim agent`:**
    *   `status`: Will transition from `pending` to `in progress` when the agent starts executing the first step of a plan.
    *   `updatedAt`: Will be updated whenever the plan file is modified by the agent (e.g., status change, step completion).
    *   `changedFiles`: After each step is marked done (in `markStepDone`), this field will be updated by comparing the current state of files against the `baseBranch` (or `main`/`master` if `baseBranch` is not set).
    *   `status`: Will transition to `done` in `markStepDone` if all tasks and their steps in the plan are completed.

**Constraints:**
*   The existing LLM prompt for plan generation (`src/tim/prompt.ts`) and the initial Markdown-to-YAML conversion logic performed by the LLM (within `convertMarkdownToYaml` in `src/tim/cleanup.ts`) **should not** be changed to handle these new fields. These fields are metadata to be added *after* the LLM produces the core plan structure.
*   Fields like `dependencies`, `baseBranch`, and `pullRequest` can be left empty for now and will be utilized more in future work.
*   Existing functionality for parsing `rmpr:` comments (in `src/rmpr/comment_options.ts`) should be adapted for parsing `rmfilter:` comments.
*   Existing functionality for finding changed files (e.g., `getChangedFiles` in `src/rmfilter/additional_docs.ts`) should be reused.

The implementation will be broken down into tasks focusing on schema updates, ID generation, metadata initialization, and runtime state management, with tests for each new piece of functionality.
