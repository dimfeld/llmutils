title: Revamp plan format to have plan as front matter and details as markdown
  content afterwards
goal: "Implement: Revamp plan format to have plan as front matter and details as
  markdown content afterwards"
details: >-
  Should look like this:


  ```markdown

  ---

  id: 1

  title: a plan

  # And other keys here

  ---


  And then the details go here

  ```


  Update readPlanFile and writePlanFile to transparently parse this and move the
  body text in and out of the `details` field.


  If you read a plan that still has a `details` field in the YAML itself, then
  combine that with any body text.
