title: Per-model environment override
goal: "Implement: Per-model environment override"
details: For some models it may be useful to support using a different
  environment variable for the api key. Add values to the rmplan config that
  allow specifying, for a model or a prefix, a different environment to get the
  key from and then use that in createModel.
