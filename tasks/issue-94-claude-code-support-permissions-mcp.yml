title: "Claude Code: Support Permissions MCP"
goal: "Implement: Claude Code: Support Permissions MCP"
priority: medium
details: >-
  Claude Code SDK is able to use an MCP server to request permissions. Implement
  this and then ask the user to respond to permissions when Claude Code needs
  it.


  The arguments and expected response format for the MCP don't seem to be
  documented yet (cf https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/1175)


  See https://github.com/mmarcen/test_permission-prompt-tool for an unofficial
  example that is supposed to work.
