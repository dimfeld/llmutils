title: "Claude Code: Support Permissions MCP"
goal: "Implement: Claude Code: Support Permissions MCP"
priority: medium
details: >-
  Claude Code SDK is able to use an MCP server to request permissions. Implement
  this and then ask the user to respond to permissions when Claude Code needs
  it. Follow the tutorial for instructions on how to do so.

  The permissions prompt should print the tool_name and input as YAML, and then
  use an inquirer confirm prompt to ask the user if they want to allow the tool.
