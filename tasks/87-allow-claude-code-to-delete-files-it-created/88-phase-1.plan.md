title: Allow Claude Code to delete files it created - Implement Core File
  Tracking and Auto-Approval Logic
goal: To implement the fundamental mechanism for tracking created/modified files
  and auto-approving their deletion, without the user-facing configuration.

tasks:
  - title: Add a file tracking set to the executor state
    done: true
    description: >
      A new `Set<string>` will be added to the ClaudeCodeExecutor class to store
      the absolute paths of files that have been written to or edited. This set
      will be initialized as empty at the beginning of each execution session
      and will persist throughout the session to track all file operations. The
      set should be stored as a private property in the class and initialized in
      the constructor or at the start of the execute method.
  - title: Track file paths written by Write, Edit, and MultiEdit
    done: true
    description: >
      The formatJsonMessage function currently parses tool use requests from
      Claude Code and formats them as text to output. This function should be
      modified so that it also returns the file paths referenced by those tools.
      The function signature should change to return an object containing both
      the formatted message and an array of file paths. The code in
      claude_code.ts that calls formatJsonMessage should be updated to handle
      this new return type and add any extracted file paths to the trackedFiles
      set.
  - title: Implement rm command parsing in the permission handler
    done: true
    description: >
      Logic will be added to parse Bash commands and identify file deletion
      operations. This parser should recognize various forms of rm commands
      including `rm <path>`, `rm -f <path>`, `rm -rf <path>`, and handle edge
      cases like quoted paths. The parser should extract the file path
      argument(s) from the command string and return them in a normalized form.
  - title: Implement auto-approval for tracked file deletions
    done: true
    description: >
      The Bash tool permission handler in createPermissionSocketServer will be
      updated to use the new parsing logic. When a permission request comes in
      for the Bash tool, it will check if the command is a file deletion
      operation using the rm command parser. If it is, it will extract the file
      path and check if it exists in the trackedFiles set. If the file path
      matches a tracked file, the handler will immediately return an approval
      without prompting the user, allowing Claude Code to seamlessly delete
      files it created.

This phase focuses on building the core functionality. We will introduce a stateful set within the executor to keep track of file paths touched by file-writing tools. We will then modify the permission-handling logic for the `bash` tool to recognize `rm` commands and check them against this set, auto-approving if a match is found. For this phase, the feature will be treated as always-on to simplify development and testing.
