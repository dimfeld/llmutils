  - title: Add a configuration option to enable or disable auto-approval
    done: true
    description: >
      The code executor's configuration structure will be updated to include a
      new optional boolean property, `autoApproveCreatedFileDeletion`, which
      will default to `false` to maintain backward compatibility and safe
      defaults. This property will be added to the claudeCodeOptionsSchema in
      schemas.ts, following the existing pattern used for other optional
      configuration properties like `permissionsMcp`.
  - title: Connect the configuration flag to the auto-approval logic
    done: true
    description: >
      The auto-approval logic implemented in Phase 1 (lines 285-315 of
      claude_code.ts) will be wrapped in a conditional check. The system will
      now only attempt to auto-approve a deletion if
      `autoApproveCreatedFileDeletion` is set to `true` in the executor's
      configuration. This ensures the feature is opt-in and maintains backward
      compatibility with existing configurations.
  - title: Implement logging for auto-approved deletions
    done: true
    description: >
      A log statement already exists in the permission handler at line 301-305.
      When a file deletion is successfully auto-approved, it prints
      "Auto-approving rm command for tracked file(s): <paths>" using
      chalk.green. This task involves verifying the existing logging is
      sufficient and matches the requirements.
  - title: Update tests to cover the configuration flag
    done: true
    description: >
      The integration tests from Phase 1 will be expanded. New test cases will
      be added to verify that the feature is disabled by default and that it can
      be enabled and disabled correctly via the new configuration flag. Tests
      should cover scenarios where the flag is true, false, and undefined to
      ensure proper default behavior.
  - title: Update project documentation
    done: true
    description: >
      The README.md file will be updated to describe the new
      `autoApproveCreatedFileDeletion` configuration option. The documentation
      will explain its purpose, default value, and how to use it. This should be
      added to the Claude Code Executor section, following the existing
      documentation pattern for other executor configuration options.

Building on the core logic from Phase 1, this phase will introduce a formal configuration flag, `autoApproveCreatedFileDeletion`, to enable or disable the feature. The auto-approval logic will be made conditional on this flag. We will also add a log message that is printed whenever a deletion is auto-approved, ensuring the user is aware of the action. Finally, we will update the project's documentation to inform users about the new feature.
