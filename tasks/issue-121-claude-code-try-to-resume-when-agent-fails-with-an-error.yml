title: "Claude Code: try to resume when agent fails with an error"
goal: "Implement: Claude Code: try to resume when agent fails with an error"
details: >-
  If claude ends with a nonzero exit code, and it doesn't look like a 429 error,
  then restart claude with `-r <session id>` and try to continue. If it exits
  with a nonzero code more than 3 times in a short amount of time (2 minutes?)
  then quit with an error.

  Update: Cancelling this since Claude Code handles this pretty well internally now.
