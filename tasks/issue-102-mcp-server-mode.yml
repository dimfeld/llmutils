Allow running as an MCP server. Tools should include:

- list all plans, ready plans, plans upstream/downstream of a particular plan, etc.
- get details for a plan
- get next ready plan
- update task status
- update information on a task (set command)

Also expose the planning prompts as prompt resources.


Consider https://www.npmjs.com/package/fastmcp for the MCP server framework, which we are already using elsewhere..
