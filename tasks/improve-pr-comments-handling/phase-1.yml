title: Robust Line Number Handling and Removal of
  `originalLine`/`originalStartLine` Usage
goal: To refactor the existing PR comment processing logic to exclusively use
  current line information (`thread.line`, `thread.startLine`) and correctly
  handle `diffSide`, thereby eliminating all usage of `originalLine` and
  `originalStartLine`.

  title: Enhanced PR Comment Processing with Hybrid Context Mode and Robust Line
    Handling
  goal: To improve the handling of Pull Request (PR) review comments by
    introducing a new "hybrid context" mode that combines the benefits of inline
    AI comments and separate diff contexts, and by refactoring the system to use
    current diff line numbers consistently, eliminating reliance on
    `originalLine` and `originalStartLine`.
  details: >
    This project aims to enhance the `rmpr` tool's capability to assist
    developers in addressing PR feedback.

    Currently, `rmpr` offers two main modes for presenting review comments to an
    AI:

    1.  **Inline Comments Mode**: Embeds AI-readable comments directly into the
    full source code files. This is good for showing the AI *where* in the
    current file a change is needed.

    2.  **Separate Context Mode**: Presents each review comment alongside its
    corresponding diff hunk. This gives the AI the "before" and "after" context
    of the change being discussed.


    The first major goal is to create a new **Hybrid Context Mode**. This mode
    will:

    *   Insert AI-style comments into the full file content, similar to the
    inline mode.

    *   Simultaneously provide the original diff hunk associated with each
    comment, giving the AI both the precise location in the current file and the
    specific diff context the reviewer was seeing.


    The second major goal is to improve diff line handling as outlined in
    `docs/github-diffs.md` and the project requirements:

    *   **Eliminate `originalLine` and `originalStartLine`**: The system must
    stop using `thread.originalLine` and `thread.originalStartLine` from
    GitHub's review comment data. All line positioning must rely on
    `thread.line` and `thread.startLine` (which refer to the current state of
    the diff) or, if those are unavailable (e.g., for outdated comments), on
    matching the `diffHunk` content against the current file.

    *   **Proper `diffSide: 'LEFT'` Handling**: Ensure line numbers are
    correctly interpreted when `thread.diffSide` is `LEFT` (i.e., the comment
    refers to the "old" or "removed" side of the diff).


    These changes will make the AI's understanding of review comments more
    robust and accurate, leading to better-automated code modifications.
tasks:
  - title: Modify `DetailedReviewComment` processing to ignore `originalLine` and
      `originalStartLine`
    done: true
    description: >
      This task involves a thorough review and update of all code that consumes
      `DetailedReviewComment` objects. The focus will be on ensuring that line
      positioning logic within `src/rmpr/modes/inline_comments.ts`,
      `src/rmpr/modes/separate_context.ts`, and the comment selection UI in
      `src/common/github/pull_requests.ts` (`selectReviewComments`) exclusively
      uses `thread.line` and `thread.startLine`. Any existing fallbacks or
      direct usages of `thread.originalLine` or `thread.originalStartLine` must
      be removed. For comments where `thread.line` and `thread.startLine` are
      null (e.g., outdated or file-level comments), a new strategy for handling
      or placing these comments, potentially relying on `diffHunk` content
      matching or marking them as non-positionable for inline modes, will be
      established.
  - title: Enhance `findBestMatchLine` for `inline_comments.ts` to operate without
      `originalLine` references
    done: true
    description: >
      The `findBestMatchLine` function in `src/rmpr/modes/inline_comments.ts`,
      which is crucial for placing AI comments, will be refactored. It must use
      `thread.line` (and `thread.startLine` if available) as the primary input
      for determining the comment's location. When `thread.line` is null (e.g.,
      for an outdated comment), the function's matching capability will rely
      solely on the `diffForContext` (derived from the comment's `diffHunk`)
      against the current file content, utilizing `findClosestMatches`. The
      logic for selecting the "best" match among multiple fuzzy matches will be
      updated to no longer use `originalLine` as a guiding heuristic or
      tie-breaker, ensuring adherence to the project's constraint.
  - title: "Update `separate_context.ts` to use current line numbers and handle
      `diffSide: 'LEFT'` correctly"
    done: true
    description: >
      This task focuses on `formatReviewCommentsForSeparateContext` in
      `src/rmpr/modes/separate_context.ts`. The `lines` attribute within the
      generated `<review>` XML tag must be derived from `thread.line` and
      `thread.startLine`. The logic for inserting the "Comment: ..." text into
      the diff context display will also be updated to use `thread.line` to
      determine the correct insertion point relative to the diff lines. Special
      attention will be given to comments where `thread.diffSide` is `LEFT`; for
      these, `thread.line` refers to a line number in the "old" (pre-change)
      version of the file within that hunk. The implementation must ensure the
      comment is correctly associated with the deleted (`-`) lines or
      surrounding context lines.
  - title: Update `selectReviewComments` for accurate display and context
    done: true
    description: >
      The `selectReviewComments` function in
      `src/common/github/pull_requests.ts`, which provides the interactive
      checklist for users to select comments, will be updated. All displayed
      line numbers, the `short` path:line representation of a comment, and the
      diff context snippets (`diffForTerminal` and `diffForContext`) shown to
      the user must be based on `thread.line` and `thread.startLine`. Any
      reliance on `originalLine` or `originalStartLine` for these calculations
      or displays will be removed to ensure consistency with the new line
      handling approach.
  - title: Implement comprehensive tests for the new line handling logic
    done: true
    description: >
      New unit and integration tests will be developed, and existing ones
      updated, for `inline_comments.ts`, `separate_context.ts`, and
      `selectReviewComments`. These tests will rigorously verify the correctness
      of the new line handling logic. Test scenarios will include comments with
      `diffSide: 'RIGHT'`, `diffSide: 'LEFT'`, outdated comments (where
      `thread.line` might be null, forcing reliance on `diffHunk` matching),
      multi-line comments, and comments on context lines, added lines, and
      deleted lines. The tests will ensure that the system behaves as expected
      without any use of `originalLine` or `originalStartLine`.

This phase focuses on updating the core data structures and logic that deal with line numbers in PR review comments. The primary objective is to make the system rely on the `line` and `startLine` fields provided by the GitHub API, which reflect the comment's position in the *current* version of the diff. If these fields are null (e.g., for outdated comments or file-level comments), the system will need to use other information, such as the `diffHunk` content, for positioning, rather than falling back to `originalLine` fields.
