title: Implement `add` Command and Enhance `generate` Command
goal: To enable users to create basic plan files using a new `add` command and
  then populate these files with detailed tasks and steps using an enhanced
  `generate` command.

project:
  title: Enhance tim with `add` and `split` commands for improved plan creation
    and organization.
  goal: The overall goal of this project is to introduce two new commands, `add`
    and `split`, to the `tim` CLI tool. The `add` command will facilitate the
    quick creation of new, empty plan files. The `generate` command will be
    enhanced to populate these empty plans. The `split` command will enable
    users to break down large, existing plans into multiple, smaller phase-based
    plan files using an LLM.
  details: This project aims to improve the workflow of creating and managing
    complex project plans with `tim`. The `add` command will allow users to
    initialize a plan with a title and optional metadata like dependencies and
    priority. The `generate` command will then be able to take this stub plan
    and use an LLM to fill in the detailed tasks and steps, updating the
    existing file. The `split` command will address the need to break down
    large, already detailed plans. It will leverage an LLM to analyze the tasks
    within a single plan file and intelligently divide them into a sequence of
    new, phase-specific plan files, automatically inferring dependencies between
    these new phases. This enhancement will provide users with more flexibility
    in how they create and structure their plans, catering to both starting new
    plans from scratch and reorganizing existing ones.
tasks:
  - title: Define `add` command in `tim.ts` and implement basic YAML file creation.
    done: true
    description: >
      This task involves adding the `add` command to the main `tim.ts`
      command-line interface. The command should accept positional arguments
      which will be used as the `title` for the new plan. It will then create a
      new YAML file in the configured tasks directory (or the current directory
      if not specified). This YAML file will be initialized with a unique `id`
      (generated using `generateProjectId` from `id_utils.ts`), the provided
      `title`, and placeholder `goal` and `details` fields, adhering to the
      `PlanSchema`.
  - title: "Implement `add` command options: `edit`, `depends-on`, `priority`."
    done: true
    description: >
      This task will extend the `add` command to support several command-line
      options. The `--edit` option should open the newly generated YAML file in
      the system's default editor (specified by the `$EDITOR` environment
      variable). The `--depends-on` option will allow users to specify one or
      more plan IDs that the new plan depends on, populating the `dependencies`
      array in the YAML. The `--priority` option will set the `priority` field
      in the YAML file.
  - title: Modify `generate` command to populate tasks and steps in existing plan
      files.
    done: true
    description: >
      This task requires updating the existing `generate` command in
      `src/tim/tim.ts`. When the `generate` command is provided with a path to
      an existing plan YAML file that primarily contains metadata (like `id`,
      `title`, `goal`, `details`) but lacks a `tasks` array or has an empty one,
      it should:

      1. Load the content of the specified plan file.

      2. Use the plan's `title`, `goal`, and `details` to construct a
      descriptive text input for the LLM.

      3. Invoke an LLM (using a prompt similar to the current
      `simplePlanPrompt`) to generate the detailed `tasks`, including their
      `steps` and associated `files`.

      4. Parse the LLM's output (which is typically Markdown and then converted
      to a YAML structure).

      5. Merge the newly generated `tasks` array into the data structure loaded
      from the original plan file.

      6. Update the `planGeneratedAt` and `promptsGeneratedAt` timestamp fields
      in the plan data.

      7. Write the fully populated plan data back to the original YAML file,
      effectively updating it in place.

      This modification will likely involve adapting logic within
      `src/tim/process_markdown.ts` or `src/tim/actions.ts`.
  - title: Add tests for `add` command and updated `generate` functionality.
    done: true
    description: >
      This task focuses on creating a comprehensive suite of tests. For the
      `add` command, tests should cover its basic file creation capabilities and
      the correct handling of all its options (`--edit`, `--depends-on`,
      `--priority`). For the updated `generate` command, tests should verify its
      ability to correctly read an existing stub plan file, interact with the
      LLM (potentially mocked for deterministic testing) to populate tasks and
      steps, and save the updated content back to the original file.

This phase focuses on introducing the `add` command for scaffolding new plan files. It also involves modifying the existing `generate` command to work with these pre-existing (but empty) plan files, populating them with LLM-generated content in place, rather than always creating a new file.
