title: Implement `add` Command and Enhance `generate` Command
goal: To enable users to create basic plan files using a new `add` command and
  then populate these files with detailed tasks and steps using an enhanced
  `generate` command.
details: This phase focuses on introducing the `add` command for scaffolding new
  plan files. It also involves modifying the existing `generate` command to work
  with these pre-existing (but empty) plan files, populating them with
  LLM-generated content in place, rather than always creating a new file.

project:
  title: Enhance rmplan with `add` and `split` commands for improved plan creation
    and organization.
  goal: The overall goal of this project is to introduce two new commands, `add`
    and `split`, to the `rmplan` CLI tool. The `add` command will facilitate the
    quick creation of new, empty plan files. The `generate` command will be
    enhanced to populate these empty plans. The `split` command will enable
    users to break down large, existing plans into multiple, smaller phase-based
    plan files using an LLM.
  details: This project aims to improve the workflow of creating and managing
    complex project plans with `rmplan`. The `add` command will allow users to
    initialize a plan with a title and optional metadata like dependencies and
    priority. The `generate` command will then be able to take this stub plan
    and use an LLM to fill in the detailed tasks and steps, updating the
    existing file. The `split` command will address the need to break down
    large, already detailed plans. It will leverage an LLM to analyze the tasks
    within a single plan file and intelligently divide them into a sequence of
    new, phase-specific plan files, automatically inferring dependencies between
    these new phases. This enhancement will provide users with more flexibility
    in how they create and structure their plans, catering to both starting new
    plans from scratch and reorganizing existing ones.
tasks:
  - title: Define `add` command in `rmplan.ts` and implement basic YAML file creation.
    description: >
      This task involves adding the `add` command to the main `rmplan.ts`
      command-line interface. The command should accept positional arguments
      which will be used as the `title` for the new plan. It will then create a
      new YAML file in the configured tasks directory (or the current directory
      if not specified). This YAML file will be initialized with a unique `id`
      (generated using `generateProjectId` from `id_utils.ts`), the provided
      `title`, and placeholder `goal` and `details` fields, adhering to the
      `PlanSchema`.
    files:
      - src/rmplan/rmplan.ts
      - src/rmplan/id_utils.ts
      - src/rmplan/planSchema.ts
      - src/rmplan/configLoader.ts
      - src/rmfilter/utils.ts
    steps:
      - prompt: >
          In `src/rmplan/rmplan.ts`, define a new command `add <title...>` using
          `program.command()`.

          The `<title...>` should be a variadic positional argument to capture
          the full title.

          This command will be responsible for creating new, empty plan files.
        done: true
      - prompt: >
          Implement the action for the `add` command. Inside the action:

          1. Join the `title...` arguments to form the complete plan title
          string.

          2. Load the effective configuration using
          `loadEffectiveConfig(globalOpts.config)` from
          `src/rmplan/configLoader.ts`.

          3. Determine the target directory for the new plan file:
             - If `config.paths.tasks` is set:
               - If absolute, use it directly.
               - If relative, resolve it against the git root (use `getGitRoot()` from `src/rmfilter/utils.ts`; if no git root, resolve against `process.cwd()`).
             - Else (if `config.paths.tasks` is not set), use `process.cwd()`.
             Ensure the target directory exists, creating it if necessary using `fs.mkdir` with `recursive: true`.
        done: true
      - prompt: >
          Continue implementing the `add` command's action:

          1. Generate a unique plan ID using `generateProjectId()` from
          `src/rmplan/id_utils.ts`.

          2. Create a slugified filename from the plan title using
          `slugify(title)` from `src/rmplan/id_utils.ts`, and append `.yml`. For
          example, "My New Plan" becomes "my-new-plan.yml".

          3. Construct the full path to the new plan file within the target
          directory.
        done: true
      - prompt: >
          Continue implementing the `add` command's action:

          1. Create the initial plan object adhering to `PlanSchema` from
          `src/rmplan/planSchema.ts`. This object should include:
             - `id`: The generated unique ID.
             - `title`: The user-provided title.
             - `goal`: A placeholder string, e.g., "Goal to be defined."
             - `details`: A placeholder string, e.g., "Details to be added."
             - `status`: "pending"
             - `createdAt`: Current ISO timestamp.
             - `updatedAt`: Current ISO timestamp.
             - `tasks`: An empty array `[]`.
          2. Convert this plan object to a YAML string using `yaml.stringify()`.
          Prepend the `yaml-language-server` schema line.

          3. Write the YAML string to the new plan file using `Bun.write()`.

          4. Log a success message to the console indicating the path to the
          created file, e.g., `log(chalk.green('✓ Created plan:'), filePath);`.
        done: true
  - title: "Implement `add` command options: `edit`, `depends-on`, `priority`."
    description: >
      This task will extend the `add` command to support several command-line
      options. The `--edit` option should open the newly generated YAML file in
      the system's default editor (specified by the `$EDITOR` environment
      variable). The `--depends-on` option will allow users to specify one or
      more plan IDs that the new plan depends on, populating the `dependencies`
      array in the YAML. The `--priority` option will set the `priority` field
      in the YAML file.

      files.
    description: >
      This task requires updating the existing `generate` command in
      `src/rmplan/rmplan.ts`. When the `generate` command is provided with a
      path to an existing plan YAML file that primarily contains metadata (like
      `id`, `title`, `goal`, `details`) but lacks a `tasks` array or has an
      empty one, it should:

      1. Load the content of the specified plan file.

      2. Use the plan's `title`, `goal`, and `details` to construct a
      descriptive text input for the LLM.

      3. Invoke an LLM (using a prompt similar to the current
      `simplePlanPrompt`) to generate the detailed `tasks`, including their
      `steps` and associated `files`.

      4. Parse the LLM's output (which is typically Markdown and then converted
      to a YAML structure).

      5. Merge the newly generated `tasks` array into the data structure loaded
      from the original plan file.

      6. Update the `planGeneratedAt` and `promptsGeneratedAt` timestamp fields
      in the plan data.

      7. Write the fully populated plan data back to the original YAML file,
      effectively updating it in place.

      This modification will likely involve adapting logic within
      `src/rmplan/process_markdown.ts` or `src/rmplan/actions.ts`.

          Modify its logic to handle the case where `options.plan` (the plan
          file path) is provided.

          First, check if `options.plan` is a file path (and not `undefined`
          from `--plan-editor` or `--issue`).

          doesn't exist or reading fails, proceed with the existing "generate
          new plan" logic (e.g., treating `options.plan` content as raw plan
          text if it's not a YAML file, or erroring if it was supposed to be a
          file).

          If the file exists and is readable, parse its content as YAML using

        done: false
      - prompt: >
          After successfully parsing and validating the existing plan file,
          check if it's a "stub" plan. A stub plan is one that either has no
          `tasks` field or an empty `tasks` array.

          If it is *not* a stub plan (i.e., it already has tasks), log a message
          that the plan already contains tasks and proceed with the existing
          `generate` logic (which might involve creating a new plan based on the
          input, or simply exiting if this specific scenario isn't meant to
          overwrite). This task focuses on populating stubs.
        done: false
      - prompt: >
          If the loaded plan is a stub:

          1. Construct `planText` for the LLM using the stub's `title`, `goal`,
          and `details`.

          2. Create the LLM prompt string using `simplePlanPrompt(planText)`
          from `src/rmplan/prompt.ts`.

          3. Load the rmplan config using `loadEffectiveConfig`.

          4. Determine the model to use (e.g., `config.models.convert_yaml` or a
          default like `google/gemini-2.0-flash`). Create the model instance
          using `createModel()`.

          5. Call the LLM (e.g., `generateText({ model, prompt: llmPromptString
          })`) to get the Markdown output containing tasks and steps
          (`llmMarkdownOutput`).
        done: false

          Process the `llmMarkdownOutput`:

          1. Use `convertMarkdownToYaml(llmMarkdownOutput, config, true)` from
          `src/rmplan/process_markdown.ts` to convert the LLM's Markdown into a
          YAML string. This function itself uses an LLM.

          2. Parse this resulting YAML string (after potentially using
          `findYamlStart` and `fixYaml`) to get a temporary plan object:
          `parsedGeneratedPlan =
          yaml.parse(fixYaml(findYamlStart(yamlStringFromConvert)))`.

          3. Extract the `tasks` array from `parsedGeneratedPlan.tasks`. If
          `parsedGeneratedPlan.tasks` is not found or is not an array, handle
          this as an error (e.g., LLM failed to produce valid tasks).
        done: false
      - prompt: >
          Merge the extracted `generatedTasks` into the original `planData`
          (loaded from the stub file). Replace `planData.tasks` with

          Write this YAML string back to the original file path specified in
          `options.plan`, overwriting its content.
