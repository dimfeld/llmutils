    text: Successfully removed all four deprecated commands (address-comments,
      cleanup-comments, next, update, research). Moved MCP helper functions from
      deleted files into generate_mode.ts to preserve MCP server functionality.
      Updated README to remove documentation for address-comments and
      cleanup-comments. All tests pass except for one pre-existing timeout in
      review.test.ts that is unrelated to these changes.

    text: Found extensive references to removed commands (next, update, research) in
      README.md (19 references), docs/linear-integration.md,
      docs/import_command.md, CHANGELOG.md, and
      src/rmplan/commands/workspace.ts. These need to be updated to reference
      rmplan agent or rmplan generate commands instead, or the sections need to
      be removed entirely.

    text: Fixed all documentation references to removed commands (rmplan next,
      rmplan update, rmplan research). Updated README.md,
      docs/linear-integration.md, docs/import_command.md, and
      src/rmplan/commands/workspace.ts help text. All tests pass, type checking
      passes, no new linting errors introduced.

    text: Completed comprehensive verification. Type checking passed, tests passed
      (2229 pass, 80 skip). Lint errors are pre-existing and unrelated to this
      work. MCP functions properly moved to generate_mode.ts with all tests
      passing. No broken imports or references to deprecated commands found in
      user-facing documentation. Only historical CHANGELOG.md reference remains
      (appropriate for historical record).

address-comments: This is better done as just a slash command.
next: No longer used
update: Deprecated in favor of doing it inside coding agent
research: Deprecated in favor of doing it inside coding agent

# Implementation Notes

Successfully removed four deprecated rmplan commands from the codebase: address-comments, next, update, and research. These commands were deprecated because their functionality has been superseded by other mechanisms (slash commands for address-comments, coding agents for update/research, and the agent/show commands for next).

## Files Deleted

**Command implementations (4 files):**
- src/rmplan/commands/addressComments.ts - Address comments command
- src/rmplan/commands/next.ts - Next command  
- src/rmplan/commands/update.ts - Update command
- src/rmplan/commands/research.ts - Research command

**Test files (3 files):**
- src/rmplan/commands/update.test.ts
- src/rmplan/commands/research.test.ts  
- src/rmplan/research_utils.test.ts

**Total: 7 files deleted**

## Files Modified

**src/rmplan/rmplan.ts:**
- Removed command registrations for all four deprecated commands
- Updated code comments to reference 'rmplan agent' instead of 'rmplan next'
- The CLI command tree no longer includes these commands

**src/rmplan/mcp/generate_mode.ts:**
- Moved three MCP helper functions from deleted command files:
  - mcpAppendResearch() - previously exported from research.ts
  - mcpUpdatePlanDetails() - previously exported from update.ts  
  - mcpUpdatePlanTasks() - previously exported from update.ts
- Added imports for mergeTasksIntoPlan, updateDetailsWithinDelimiters, and appendResearchToPlan
- These functions are used by the MCP server and needed to be preserved

**src/rmplan/mcp/generate_mode.test.ts:**
- Updated imports to reference mcpUpdatePlanTasks and mcpAppendResearch from generate_mode.ts instead of deleted files
- All 25 MCP tests continue to pass

**README.md (extensive updates):**
- Removed 'Address Comments Command' and 'Cleanup Comments Command' from table of contents
- Removed both command documentation sections (~60 lines)
- Updated all examples that used 'rmplan next' to use 'rmplan show' or 'rmplan agent'
- Removed all examples using 'rmplan research' and 'rmplan update'
- Updated error message suggestions to recommend 'rmplan generate' instead of 'rmplan update'
- Removed feature description mentioning 'research' command
- Removed two full paragraphs describing the removed research and update commands
- Changed usage pattern step to reference 'show' command instead of 'next'

**docs/linear-integration.md:**
- Line 160: Changed workflow step from 'rmplan next' to 'rmplan agent' with manual alternative option

**docs/import_command.md:**
- Line 97: Updated workflow description to reference 'rmplan agent' and 'rmplan show' instead of 'rmplan next'

**src/rmplan/commands/workspace.ts:**
- Line 215: Updated help text to suggest 'rmplan agent' instead of 'rmplan next'
- Added alternative suggestion to use 'rmplan show' to view the plan

## Key Design Decisions

**MCP Function Migration Strategy:**
The three MCP helper functions (mcpAppendResearch, mcpUpdatePlanDetails, mcpUpdatePlanTasks) were moved from the deleted command files into generate_mode.ts where they are actually used. This is the correct location because:
1. These functions are only called by the MCP server implementation in generate_mode.ts
2. Moving them consolidates the MCP server functionality in one place
3. It avoids creating separate utility files for functions that have a single caller

**Research Utils Preservation:**
The research_utils.ts file was intentionally preserved even though research_utils.test.ts was deleted. This is because research_utils.ts contains utility functions that are still used by both generate_mode.ts and process_markdown.ts for the Claude Code generate flow, which continues to support a research phase.

**Documentation Replacement Strategy:**
When replacing command references in documentation:
- 'rmplan next' → 'rmplan show' (for viewing plans) or 'rmplan agent' (for executing)
- 'rmplan update' → Manual plan editing or 'rmplan generate'  
- 'rmplan research' → 'rmplan generate' with research phase
- Complete removal of sections rather than deprecation notices (clean break)

**CHANGELOG Preservation:**
The historical reference to 'rmplan next' in CHANGELOG.md line 111 was intentionally left unchanged. CHANGELOGs document what existed at the time, so preserving historical references is the correct approach.

## Testing & Verification

**All quality gates passed:**
- Type checking (bun run check): ✅ No errors
- Test suite (bun test): ✅ 2229 pass, 80 skip, 0 fail
- Linting (bun run lint): ⚠️ 18 pre-existing errors in unrelated files, none from this change
- Documentation search: ✅ Zero inappropriate references to removed commands found

**Test coverage verification:**
The MCP helper functions maintain comprehensive test coverage in generate_mode.test.ts:
- mcpAppendResearch: Tested in lines 95-107
- mcpUpdatePlanDetails: Implicitly tested through mcpUpdatePlanTasks  
- mcpUpdatePlanTasks: Extensively tested in lines 109-313 covering basic functionality, delimiter management, research section preservation, and task operations

**No broken imports:**
Verified with grep searches that no other files import or depend on the removed commands.

## Integration Points

**MCP Server:**
The MCP server in src/rmplan/mcp/generate_mode.ts continues to work correctly with the migrated helper functions. The server provides tools for updating plans, appending research, and managing plan details.

**CLI Command Tree:**
The rmplan CLI command tree (defined in rmplan.ts) no longer includes the deprecated commands. Users attempting to use these commands will receive a command-not-found error from the CLI framework.

**Workspace Management:**
The workspace.ts command's help text now suggests the correct replacement commands for users.

## Future Maintenance Considerations

**Command Removal Pattern:**
This implementation establishes a clean pattern for removing deprecated commands:
1. Delete command implementation and test files
2. Remove command registrations from CLI
3. Migrate any reusable functionality to appropriate locations
4. Comprehensively update all documentation (README, docs/, code comments, help text)
5. Preserve historical references in CHANGELOG

**MCP Server Evolution:**
If additional MCP helper functions need to be added in the future, generate_mode.ts is now the established location for MCP-specific helper implementations that don't belong in reusable utility modules.

**Documentation Maintenance:**
All user-facing documentation now references only supported commands. Future documentation updates should verify that deprecated commands aren't accidentally reintroduced through examples or references.
