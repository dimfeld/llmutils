      It needs to listen on a dynamic port (port 0) and communicate this port
      back to its parent process via IPC. This change is necessary so that it
      can interact with the user via the terminal, which is not possible when
      started by Claude Code in stdio mode.

      use it to configure Claude Code, and ensure the server is terminated after
      the execution is complete.

When Claude Code starts the MCP in stdio mode, it can't communicate with the user.
Instead we need to use HTTP SSE transport to get the user's input. Convert it to an FastMCP
server using the tutorial.

The MCP server should be started with an IPC pipe using Bun.spawn, and it should be able to listen on port 0 and then send the port number
back to the parent via process.send.

An example of receiving the message:
```
let portPromise = Promise.withResolvers();
const child = Bun.spawn(["bun", "child.ts"], {
  ipc(message) {
    portPromise.resolve(message.port);
  },
});

// await the port number, but with a timeout
```

The executor should manually start the MCP before starting claude code, with stdio set to `inherit`, and shut it down when it is done.
It should listen for the port number from the child process, and then put that port number into the generated MCP JSON.
The MCP JSON should be updated to use type: 'sse', and url: 'http://localhost:${port}/sse'.
