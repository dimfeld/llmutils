## Overview

Enhance `rmplan generate` to help agents identify prerequisite work that should be done first. This adds a `--with-blocking-subissues` flag that prompts the LLM to identify blocking work, then offers to create those as separate plans with proper dependencies.

## Changes Required

### 1. Add CLI Flag

File: `src/rmplan/rmplan.ts` (in the generate command definition)

```typescript
.option('--with-blocking-subissues', 'Prompt LLM to identify and create blocking prerequisite plans')
```

### 2. Update Prompt Generation

File: `src/rmplan/commands/generate.ts`

When `options.withBlockingSubissues` is true, add this section to the LLM prompt:

```markdown
# Blocking Subissues

Before proposing the main implementation tasks, identify any prerequisite work
that should be completed first. For each prerequisite:
1. Determine if it should be a separate plan
2. Suggest a title, priority, and relationship to this plan
3. Explain why it's a prerequisite

Format blocking subissues as:
## Blocking Subissue: [Title]
- Priority: [high|medium|low]
- Relationship: [dependency|research|infrastructure]
- Reason: [Why this must be done first]
- Tasks: [High-level task list]
```

### 3. Parse and Create Subissues

After the LLM responds, parse the blocking subissues section:

```typescript
const blockingRegex = /## Blocking Subissue: (.+?)\n- Priority: (.+?)\n- Relationship: (.+?)\n- Reason: (.+?)\n- Tasks: ([\s\S]+?)(?=## Blocking Subissue:|$)/g;

const subissues = [];
let match;
while ((match = blockingRegex.exec(llmOutput)) !== null) {
  subissues.push({
    title: match[1].trim(),
    priority: match[2].trim(),
    relationship: match[3].trim(),
    reason: match[4].trim(),
    tasks: match[5].trim(),
  });
}
```

Then offer to create them:

```typescript
if (subissues.length > 0) {
  log(chalk.yellow(`\nLLM identified ${subissues.length} blocking subissues`));
  
  const shouldCreate = await confirm({
    message: 'Create these as separate plans?',
    default: true,
  });
  
  if (shouldCreate) {
    const createdIds = [];
    for (const subissue of subissues) {
      // Create plan using rmplan add command programmatically
      const newPlanId = await createPlan({
        title: subissue.title,
        priority: subissue.priority,
        parent: currentPlanId, // if this is part of a hierarchy
        details: `${subissue.reason}\n\n## Tasks\n${subissue.tasks}`,
      });
      createdIds.push(newPlanId);
    }
    
    // Add created plan IDs as dependencies to current plan
    await updatePlanDependencies(currentPlanId, createdIds);
    
    log(chalk.green(`âœ“ Created ${createdIds.length} blocking plans: ${createdIds.join(', ')}`));
  }
}
```

## Example Usage

```bash
# Generate plan with blocking subissue detection
rmplan generate 42 --with-blocking-subissues
```

LLM might respond:

```
## Blocking Subissue: Set up authentication infrastructure
- Priority: high
- Relationship: infrastructure
- Reason: The main tasks require auth middleware which doesn't exist yet
- Tasks:
  1. Install passport.js and configure strategies
  2. Create auth middleware
  3. Add user session management

## Blocking Subissue: Research rate limiting approaches
- Priority: medium  
- Relationship: research
- Reason: Need to decide on rate limiting strategy before implementing endpoints
- Tasks:
  1. Compare redis-based vs in-memory solutions
  2. Document decision and rationale
```

Then the command would offer to create plans 143 (auth infrastructure) and 144 (research), and update plan 42 to depend on them.

## Use Case

This helps agents:
1. Break down work more granularly
2. Avoid starting implementation before prerequisites are ready
3. Track why certain work needs to happen in a specific order
4. Use `discoveredFrom` to link the subissues back to the parent plan

## Testing

- Generate with flag, verify prompt includes blocking subissue section
- Mock LLM response with subissues, verify parsing works
- Accept creation prompt, verify plans are created with correct fields
- Decline creation prompt, verify plans are not created
- Verify dependencies are added correctly to parent plan

## Dependencies

Depends on plan 129 for `discoveredFrom` field (subissues should be marked with `--discovered-from <parent-plan-id>`).
