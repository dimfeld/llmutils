title: research command
goal: ""
details: >
  The `rmplan` command should support a `research [planArg]` option that creates
  a prompt encouraging the model to do research related

  to the goal and details in the plan, and copies it to the clipboard.


  This command should have an --rmfilter option which, if there are any rmfilter
  arguments in the plan, use rmfilter to generate the prompt and include these
  files. Also allow adding

  them on the command line with the `--` CLI argument separator that other
  commands use.


  When the user pastes their content back in, append it to the end of the plan
  details.
