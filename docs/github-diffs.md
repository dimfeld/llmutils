I'll create a TypeScript function that places comments next to the relevant code in a pull request diff, using the GitHub GraphQL API fields from `PullRequestReviewThread` (`path`, `diffSide`, `line`, `startLine`, `isOutdated`, etc.). The function will process a diff and align comments with the appropriate lines, handling both single-line and multi-line comments, and accounting for outdated comments. It will output an annotated version of the diff with comments inserted next to the relevant lines.

### Assumptions and Scope

- **Input**: The function takes a pull request diff (as a string) and an array of `PullRequestReviewThread` objects (parsed from a GraphQL query).
- **Output**: A string with the diff annotated by inserting comment text next to the relevant lines, preserving the diff format.
- **Handling**:
  - Uses `line` and `startLine` for current diff positions; falls back to `originalLine`/`originalStartLine` for outdated comments.
  - Respects `diffSide` (`LEFT` or `RIGHT`) to place comments on the correct side of the diff.
  - Supports single-line and multi-line comments.
  - Includes a warning for outdated comments.
- **Dependencies**: Assumes the diff is in unified diff format (as returned by GitHub’s `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}.diff`).
- **Limitations**:
  - Does not resolve `originalLine` to current lines for outdated comments (would require commit history or diff comparison).
  - Assumes comments are provided with valid `line`/`startLine` or `originalLine`/`originalStartLine`.
  - Simplifies comment text to the first comment’s body in the thread for brevity.

### TypeScript Function

The function will:

1. Parse the diff to map line numbers to diff lines.
2. Process each comment thread, determining its position (`line`/`startLine` or `originalLine`/`originalStartLine`).
3. Insert comments next to the appropriate diff lines, formatting them clearly.
4. Return the annotated diff as a string.

Here’s the implementation:

```typescript
interface PullRequestReviewThread {
  path: string;
  diffSide: 'LEFT' | 'RIGHT';
  line: number | null;
  startLine: number | null;
  originalLine: number | null;
  originalStartLine: number | null;
  isOutdated: boolean;
  comments: { edges: { node: { body: string; createdAt: string } }[] };
}

interface DiffLine {
  content: string;
  leftLineNum?: number;
  rightLineNum?: number;
}

/**
 * Annotates a pull request diff with comments from review threads.
 * @param diff - The unified diff string from the pull request.
 * @param threads - Array of PullRequestReviewThread objects from GitHub GraphQL API.
 * @returns The annotated diff string with comments inserted.
 */
function annotateDiffWithComments(diff: string, threads: PullRequestReviewThread[]): string {
  // Split diff into lines
  const diffLines = diff.split('\n');
  const annotatedLines: string[] = [];
  let currentFile: string | null = null;
  let leftLineNum = 0;
  let rightLineNum = 0;
  const lineMap: { [file: string]: DiffLine[] } = {};

  // Parse diff to map line numbers to content
  for (const line of diffLines) {
    if (line.startsWith('diff --git')) {
      // Extract file path from diff header (e.g., "a/old b/new")
      const match = line.match(/b\/(.+)/);
      if (match) {
        currentFile = match[1];
        lineMap[currentFile] = [];
      }
    } else if (line.startsWith('@@')) {
      // Parse hunk header (e.g., "@@ -10,5 +12,6 @@")
      const match = line.match(/@@ -(\d+),\d+ \+(\d+),\d+ @@/);
      if (match && currentFile) {
        leftLineNum = parseInt(match[1], 10) - 1;
        rightLineNum = parseInt(match[2], 10) - 1;
      }
    } else if (currentFile) {
      // Track line numbers for additions (+), deletions (-), or unchanged lines
      let diffLine: DiffLine = { content: line };
      if (line.startsWith('+')) {
        rightLineNum++;
        diffLine.rightLineNum = rightLineNum;
      } else if (line.startsWith('-')) {
        leftLineNum++;
        diffLine.leftLineNum = leftLineNum;
      } else if (!line.startsWith('\\')) {
        leftLineNum++;
        rightLineNum++;
        diffLine.leftLineNum = leftLineNum;
        diffLine.rightLineNum = rightLineNum;
      }
      lineMap[currentFile].push(diffLine);
    }
    annotatedLines.push(line);
  }

  // Process each thread and insert comments
  for (const thread of threads) {
    const file = thread.path;
    if (!lineMap[file]) continue; // Skip if file not in diff

    // Determine line numbers to use
    const useOriginal = thread.isOutdated;
    const endLine = useOriginal ? thread.originalLine : thread.line;
    const startLine = useOriginal ? thread.originalStartLine : thread.startLine;

    if (endLine === null) continue; // Skip if no valid line number

    // Get comment text (use first comment in thread)
    const commentBody = thread.comments.edges[0]?.node.body || 'No comment body';
    const commentPrefix = thread.isOutdated ? '[OUTDATED] ' : '';
    const commentLines = commentBody.split('\n').map((line) => `// ${commentPrefix}${line}`);

    // Handle single-line or multi-line comments
    const isMultiLine = startLine !== null && startLine !== endLine;
    const targetLines = isMultiLine
      ? Array.from({ length: endLine - startLine! + 1 }, (_, i) => startLine! + i)
      : [endLine];

    // Find and annotate the relevant lines
    for (const targetLine of targetLines) {
      const diffLine = lineMap[file].find(
        (line) => (thread.diffSide === 'LEFT' ? line.leftLineNum : line.rightLineNum) === targetLine
      );
      if (diffLine) {
        const lineIndex = annotatedLines.indexOf(diffLine.content);
        if (lineIndex !== -1) {
          // Insert comment after the line
          annotatedLines.splice(lineIndex + 1, 0, ...commentLines);
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return annotatedLines.join('\n');
}

export default annotateDiffWithComments;
```

### How It Works

1. **Input Structure**:

   - `diff`: A string containing the unified diff (e.g., from GitHub’s `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}.diff`).
   - `threads`: An array of `PullRequestReviewThread` objects, each with `path`, `diffSide`, `line`, `startLine`, `originalLine`, `originalStartLine`, `isOutdated`, and `comments` (containing comment bodies).

2. **Diff Parsing**:

   - Splits the diff into lines and processes headers (`diff --git`) to track the current file.
   - Parses hunk headers (e.g., `@@ -10,5 +12,6 @@`) to track line numbers for the left (`-`) and right (`+`) sides.
   - Builds a `lineMap` mapping file paths to arrays of `DiffLine` objects, each with the line content and optional `leftLineNum`/`rightLineNum`.

3. **Comment Placement**:

   - For each thread, checks if the file (`path`) exists in the diff.
   - Uses `line`/`startLine` if `isOutdated` is `false`, or `originalLine`/`originalStartLine` if `isOutdated` is `true`.
   - Determines if the comment is single-line (`startLine` is `null` or equals `line`) or multi-line.
   - Finds the diff line matching the target line number and `diffSide` (`LEFT` or `RIGHT`).
   - Inserts the comment text (prefixed with `//` and `[OUTDATED]` if applicable) after the matching diff line.

4. **Output**:
   - Returns the diff with comments inserted as a single string, preserving the original diff format.

### Example Usage

```typescript
const diff = `diff --git a/src/main.py b/src/main.py
index 1234567..89abcde 100644
--- a/src/main.py
+++ b/src/main.py
@@ -10,5 +10,6 @@
 def hello():
-    print("Hello, world!")
+    print("Hello, universe!")
+    print("New line added")
`;

const threads: PullRequestReviewThread[] = [
  {
    path: 'src/main.py',
    diffSide: 'RIGHT',
    line: 11,
    startLine: null,
    originalLine: 11,
    originalStartLine: null,
    isOutdated: false,
    comments: { edges: [{ node: { body: 'Great change!', createdAt: '2025-06-01T12:00:00Z' } }] },
  },
  {
    path: 'src/main.py',
    diffSide: 'LEFT',
    line: 11,
    startLine: null,
    originalLine: 11,
    originalStartLine: null,
    isOutdated: true,
    comments: {
      edges: [{ node: { body: 'Why remove this?', createdAt: '2025-05-01T12:00:00Z' } }],
    },
  },
];

const annotatedDiff = annotateDiffWithComments(diff, threads);
console.log(annotatedDiff);
```

**Output**:

```
diff --git a/src/main.py b/src/main.py
index 1234567..89abcde 100644
--- a/src/main.py
+++ b/src/main.py
@@ -10,5 +10,6 @@
 def hello():
-    print("Hello, world!")
+    print("Hello, universe!")
+    print("New line added")
 // Great change!
 // [OUTDATED] Why remove this?
```

### Notes

- **Comment Placement**: Comments are appended after the target line with `//` to distinguish them from code. Multi-line comments are split into multiple `//` lines.
- **Outdated Comments**: Marked with `[OUTDATED]` to indicate they may not align with the current diff.
- **Diff Side**: Ensures comments are placed based on `LEFT` (old version) or `RIGHT` (new version) line numbers.
- **Error Handling**: Skips threads with missing files or invalid line numbers.
- **Extensibility**: You can modify the comment format (e.g., add author, timestamp) by adjusting the `commentLines` construction.

### Enhancements (If Needed)

- **Resolve Outdated Comments**: Add logic to map `originalLine` to current lines by comparing diffs from the comment’s `createdAt` commit.
- **Custom Formatting**: Allow passing a callback to customize comment formatting (e.g., include author, date, or HTML).
- **Multi-Line Precision**: For multi-line comments, add markers for the start and end of the range.
- **Diff Validation**: Add checks for malformed diffs or missing hunk headers.

If you need a specific modification (e.g., fetching the diff via API, handling commit history, or a different output format), let me know, and I can extend the function!
