When writing new commands that can use a plan file, always take either a plan ID or file path, and use `resolvePlanFile` in src/rmplan/plans.ts to find the file.

Its structure looks like:

```
/**
 * Resolves a plan argument which can be either a file path or a plan ID.
 * If the argument is a file path that exists, returns the absolute path.
 * If the argument looks like a plan ID, searches for a matching plan in the tasks directory.
 *
 * @param planArg - The plan file path or plan ID
 * @param configPath - Optional path to rmplan config file
 * @returns The resolved absolute file path
 * @throws Error if the plan cannot be found
 */
export async function resolvePlanFile(planArg: string, configPath?: string): Promise<string>;
```
