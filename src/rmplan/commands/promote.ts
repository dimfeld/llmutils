  // TODO: Implement the actual promotion logic
  // This will involve:
  // 1. Parse the task IDs using parseTaskIds utility
  // 2. Load the source plans and extract the specified tasks
  // 3. Create new top-level plans from the promoted tasks
  // 4. Update dependencies between original and promoted plans
  // 5. Update the original plans to remove promoted tasks and add dependencies
