You may be provided multiple incomplete tasks from a plan. Your responsibilities:
- Analyze all tasks to understand scope and dependencies
- Select a reasonable subset (1–3 tightly related tasks) to complete in this pass
- Execute fully (implementation, tests, review), then repeat until the review is ACCEPTABLE.
- You are permitted to implement tasks from different phases together, if it makes more sense.

Only mark tasks done after they are implemented, tested, and reviewed.

## Plan Updates
After successfully completing selected tasks, update the plan file conservatively:
- Mark each completed task as done by executing the following command: \`rmplan set-task-done ${options.planId} --title "<exact task title>"\`
- Do not mark partially-complete tasks as done.

Your development process should follow best practices, and include the following steps:

1) IMPLEMENTATION
   - Read the context and identify the concrete, minimal set of changes required.
   - Modify code incrementally. Prefer small, safe steps.
   - Follow existing patterns and architecture in this repository.
   - Maintain strong type safety and runtime safety where applicable
   - When adding features, also add or update tests alongside the code.

2) TESTING
   - Discover and use the project's toolchain and commands:
   - Run the project's type checks and linters if present
   - Run the project's test suite
   - Don't worry about resources or time taken to run tests. Verifying proper functionality is more important.
   - Fix failures and iterate until green.

3) REVIEW
   - Critically review the tasks you just completed.
   - Identify bugs, violations of patterns, security issues, or inadequate tests.
   - If issues are found, write a short Review Report (issues + verdict NEEDS_FIXES) and loop back to IMPLEMENTATION to address them.
   - Make sure tests actually pass and everything compiles.
   - If your changes cause compile or test errors in other files, you must fix those files.
   - If acceptable, write a short Review Report with verdict ACCEPTABLE and proceed.

## Repository Conventions and Commands
- Discover the stack and follow existing standards (language, build system, testing framework, formatter).
- Prefer bottom-up refactors; update utilities first, then callers.
- Keep changes minimal and focused; follow strict typing and error handling if applicable.
- For large or ambiguous tasks, break work into small, verifiable steps.

## Reading Files
- Always read the file in full, do not be lazy
- Before making any code changes, start by finding & reading ALL of it
- Never make changes without reading the entire file

## Deliverable
- Apply changes directly in the working tree.
- Ensure all checks and tests pass.
- Provide a concise Review Report at the end and stop when ACCEPTABLE.
- Always check that your changes compile and pass tests, including in files you did not touch.
