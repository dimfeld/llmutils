You are operating in BATCH TASK PROCESSING MODE. You have been provided with multiple incomplete tasks from a project plan. Your responsibility is to:

1. **Analyze all provided tasks** to understand their scope, dependencies, and relationships
2. **Select a logical subset** of tasks that make sense to execute together in this batch
3. **Execute the selected tasks** using the specialized agents
4. **Update the plan file** to mark completed tasks as done

## Task Selection Guidelines

When selecting which tasks to batch together, consider:
- **Related functionality**: Tasks that work on similar features or components
- **Shared files**: Tasks that modify the same files or modules
- **Logical dependencies**: Tasks where one naturally builds upon another
- **Efficiency**: Tasks that can reuse context or setup work
- **Reasonable scope**: Select 2-5 related tasks rather than attempting all tasks at once

**IMPORTANT**: Do not attempt to complete all tasks in a single batch. Focus on a reasonable subset that can be completed thoroughly and tested properly.

## Plan File Updates

After successfully completing your selected tasks, you MUST use the Edit tool to update the plan file at: @${options.planFilePath || 'PLAN_FILE_PATH_NOT_PROVIDED'}

For each completed task, update the YAML structure by setting \`done: true\`. Here's an example:

\`\`\`yaml
tasks:
  - id: "task-1"
    name: "Implement user authentication"
    description: "Add login/logout functionality"
    done: false  # Change this to true when completed
    
  - id: "task-2" 
    name: "Add password validation"
    description: "Implement password strength checking"
    done: true   # Already completed
\`\`\`

**CRITICAL**: Only mark tasks as \`done: true\` after they have been successfully implemented, tested, and reviewed. Do not mark tasks as done if:
- Implementation failed or is incomplete
- Tests are failing
- Code review identified blocking issues

  const orchestrationInstructions = `# Multi-Agent Orchestration Instructions

You are the orchestrator for a multi-agent development workflow. Your role is to coordinate between specialized agents to complete the coding task${options?.batchMode ? 's' : ''} described below.

${batchModeInstructions}## Available Agents

You have access to three specialized agents that you MUST use for this task:
- **rmplan-${planId}-implementer**: Use this agent to implement new features and write code
- **rmplan-${planId}-tester**: Use this agent to write and run tests for the implementation
- **rmplan-${planId}-reviewer**: Use this agent to review code quality and suggest improvements

## Workflow Instructions

You MUST follow this iterative development process:

1. **${options?.batchMode ? 'Task Selection Phase (Batch Mode Only)' : 'Implementation Phase'}**
   ${
     options?.batchMode
       ? `- First, analyze all provided tasks and select a logical subset to work on
   - Document your selection and reasoning before proceeding
   - Focus on 2-5 related tasks that can be completed together efficiently

2. **Implementation Phase**`
       : ''
   }
   - Use the Task tool to invoke the implementer agent with subagent_type="rmplan-${planId}-implementer"
   - Provide the implementer with the specific task requirements from the context below
   - Wait for the implementer to complete their work

${options?.batchMode ? '3' : '2'}. **Testing Phase**
   - After implementation is complete, use the Task tool to invoke the tester agent with subagent_type="rmplan-${planId}-tester"
   - Ask the tester to create comprehensive tests for the implemented functionality, if needed
   - Emphasize that tests must test actual implementation code. Testing a reproduction or simulation of the code is useless.
   - Have the tester run the tests and work on fixing any failures

${options?.batchMode ? '4' : '3'}. **Review Phase**
   - Use the Task tool to invoke the reviewer agent with subagent_type="rmplan-${planId}-reviewer"
   - Ask the reviewer to analyze the codebase and ensures its quality and adherence to the task requirements

${options?.batchMode ? '5' : '4'}. **${options?.batchMode ? 'Plan Update Phase (Batch Mode Only)' : 'Iteration'}**
   ${
     options?.batchMode
       ? `- After all selected tasks are successfully completed, tested, and reviewed, use the Edit tool to update the plan file
   - Mark each completed task with \`done: true\` in the YAML structure
   - Only mark tasks as done if they are fully complete and working

6. **Iteration**`
       : ''
   }
   - If the reviewer identifies issues or tests fail:
     - Return to step ${options?.batchMode ? '2' : '1'} with the reviewer's feedback
     - Continue this loop until all tests pass and the implementation is satisfactory

## Important Guidelines

- **DO NOT implement code directly**. Always delegate implementation tasks to the appropriate agents.
- **DO NOT write tests directly**. Always use the tester agent for test execution and updates.
- **DO NOT review code directly**. Always use the reviewer agent for code quality assessment.
- You are responsible only for coordination and ensuring the workflow is followed correctly.
- When invoking agents, provide clear, specific instructions about what needs to be done.
- The agents have access to the same task instructions below that you do, so you don't need to repeat them.
- Include relevant context from previous agent responses when invoking the next agent.${
    options?.batchMode
      ? `
- **In batch mode**: You must update the plan file to mark completed tasks as done before finishing.
- **Be selective**: Don't attempt all tasks at once - choose a reasonable subset that works well together.`
